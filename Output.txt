Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Dawn of Manifestation 
June 13, 2018June 13, 2018John Michael Greer209 Comments 


With this post we begin a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s going to be a wild ride.
As noted in earlier posts here, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1966 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 1, “The Dawn of Manifestation,” p. 11-13.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 1, “The First Manifestation,” p. 19 through the first (partial) paragraph on p. 22.
Commentary:
Before we launch into the text, a couple of notes may be helpful. First, for those readers who haven’t tackled a work of philosophy before, this is not light reading. You know the habits of reading you use when you’re reading for pleasure—reading quickly and uncritically, letting the words weave someone else’s daydreams in your mind? That will emphatically not cut it here.
To grasp what a work of philosophy has to say, you need to go through it word by word, thought by thought, alert to the implications, watching for multiple meanings. That’s why we’re going to take an entire month to work through a chapter three pages long—and why it’s going to take us a long time to move out of what seems like profoundly abstract territory into something that seems more practical in nature. (That’s an illusion; the material we’ll be covering in this first chapter has immense practical applicability, but that probably won’t be evident for a while.)
Second, this is a work of occult philosophy. It’s meant to teach you how to think in ways that don’t come naturally to the untrained mind. What’s more, everything you’ve absorbed from the habitual mental chatter of our society might as well be designed to stop you from thinking the way this book is meant to teach you to think. The habits of thinking taught by the habitual mental chatter of society also have their place, but if that’s the only kind of thinking you know how to do, you’re stuck with a very narrow range of cognitive options. The Cosmic Doctrine will give you a much more extensive mental toolkit, and there are things you can do with it that you can’t do at all from within the stifling confines of modern materialist thinking.
To get anything at all out of The Cosmic Doctrine, though, you’re going to have to work at it, and stretch your mind in ways it may not like stretching at first. The comparison with physical exercise is a useful one: if you happen to be out of shape, your first workout is going to leave you feeling pretty uncomfortable, but if you persevere you’ll get past that discomfort and gain both enjoyment and a significant increase in health and strength.
The method this book uses to teach you how to think unfamiliar thoughts is one that was once very common in occult literature, though it’s fallen out of fashion in recent decades. “In these occult teachings,” says our text, “you will be given certain images, under which you are instructed to think of certain things. These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are designed to train the mind, not to inform it.” If you’ve ever wondered why books of alchemy show enigmatic images and follow them with equally cryptic text, or why Manly P. Hall’s famous The Secret Teachings of All Ages starts each chapter with an elaborate color plate which may or may not have anything obvious to do with the topic of the chapter—well, now you know.
The images in The Cosmic Doctrine aren’t presented in the form of lavishly illustrated color plates, and there’s a reason for that. Remember that this book was originally privately published, and issued only to members of Dion Fortune’s magical order, the Fraternity (now Society) of the Inner Light, as an aid to training. Being able to imagine things clearly is one of the basic skills of the operative mage. Whether or not you have that skill now is immaterial. As with anything else, you get it by practicing, and The Cosmic Doctrine will give you plenty of that.
Let’s begin. Take the paragraph at the beginning of the chapter (paragraph 3 of the Millennium edition) that begins “The Unmanifest is pure existence.” Read through it once quickly, to get the general shape of it, then again, slowly, thinking through each sentence. If you’re puzzled by some of it, or even by all of it, that’s a sign that you’re paying attention!
Now follow the advice of the last sentence in the paragraph. Spend a while imagining interstellar space: pure empty vastness without stars or planets. Now go through a few sentences of the paragraph, keeping the image of interstellar space in mind. At every point, refer the thoughts back to the image. As you do—and it may happen quickly, or it may take repeated effort—you’ll begin to get a clearer sense of what the text is saying about the Unmanifest.
The same method applies at every point in The Cosmic Doctrine. The images start off simple and obvious, and end up complex and subtle, but all the way through, if you picture the images in your mind and then think through the text in relation to them, you’ll have a much better shot at getting what Fortune is trying to say to you, and the text will also accomplish its primary purpose—“to train the mind, not to inform it.”
With that in mind, let’s proceed. The first concept presented is the Unmanifest. Most occult philosophies, and a great many of the non-occult kind as well, include a discussion of what the ancient Greeks called the archē, the basic “stuff” of existence. In Fortune’s account, that’s the Unmanifest, “a state of pure ‘being,’ without qualities and without history,” that is “best conceived of under the image of interstellar space.”
One useful way to think about philosophies is to count how many basic realities they posit at the foundation of existence. Usually the head count of realities comes to 0, 1, or 2. Philosophies that opt for 0, which we can call nihilist philosophies, see all apparent things as mere illusion and the sole reality as the void. Philosophiles that opt for 1, monist philosophies, see the universe in terms of some single “stuff” of which all things are modifications. Philosophies that opt for 2, dualist philosophies, hold that there are two kinds of “stuff” out of which all things are made—for example, spirit and matter.
Fortune falls squarely in the monist camp—but it’s monism with a twist. For her, there’s one fundamental “stuff,” the Unmanifest, but its characteristics make it resemble the void that’s the ultimate reality according to nihilist philosophies. The Unmanifest is, but its mode of being is so unimaginable to us that we can best think of it as the closest thing to nonbeing any of us can imagine, the empty vastness of interstellar space.
Is this true? Is the Unmanifest actually the basis for everything that we experience?  Ahem. “These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are designed to train the mind, not to inform it.”  It’s one of the more embarrassing examples of human hubris to think that our brains, which evolved for such intellectually undemanding tasks as finding food and mates on the East African savanna, are capable of understanding the foundations of existence itself. This is why philosophy presents us, not with One True Answer, but with a variety of accounts of the world, some of which are more useful for certain purposes or more congenial to certain personalities than others. The Cosmic Doctrine is one account: an account very useful for certain purposes.  What these purposes are will be discussed in in more detail as we go.
“The Unmanifest is the only Unity,” our text goes on to say. “Manifestation begins when duality occurs.” Duality—or, to give it another name, polarity—is the most important theme in The Cosmic Doctrine. The short paragraphs that follow outline our first sketch of polarity, by way of the usual interplay of image and idea. Imagine interstellar space, and then imagine some of it beginning to flow, forming a current—a current of space, in space, moving through space from space to space. Now imagine the two forces playing on the movement—the slightly stronger desire of space for momentum and the slightly weaker desire of space for inertia; imagine the second force pulling slightly on the first, making it curve; imagine the curve extended over immense distances until the current becomes a vast ring—the Ring-Cosmos.
There’s your second image. The paragraphs that describe the formation of the Ring-Cosmos give you the ideas to think about under that image. All this is metaphor, as the text says; put another way, it’s one account of the basic nature of things. Notice what it implies: that every act of creation unfolds from the intersection of two opposite and unequal forces.
This last point can be developed at very great length.  In his book The Power of Limits, the architect and sacred geometer Györgi Doczi gave this interplay of opposed unequal forces the name “dinergy,” and showed that beauty and creativity in nature and human art can best be understood as an expression of dinergy. Look at the exquisite arc made by a blade of grass bending in the wind:  the arc comes into being from the interplay of the force of the wind and the weaker but still significant resistance of the grass. That’s dinergy—and it’s also what Fortune is talking about, as the two forces transform a current in space into a Ring-Cosmos.
With that in mind, let’s go back to our text. Once the Ring-Cosmos is established, it begins to draw more empty space into its flow, and the Ring-Cosmos turns into a spinning disk. Think of it as the spinning wheel in a gyroscope, or an old-fashioned vinyl record spinning on a turntable. As it spins, it sets up stresses in the empty space beyond its outer edge, and those stresses eventually set another current of space in motion at right angles to the original current. If you picture the Ring-Cosmos as spinning horizontally, like an LP on a turntable, imagine the second current starting out vertically from a space out beyond one edge of the Ring-Cosmos. The same paired forces have the same effect on the second current as on the first, so it curves as it flows, arcing over the Ring-Cosmos, descending vertically past it off beyond its far side, and then circling back beneath the Ring-Cosmos to return to its starting point.
That gives you two rings: the Ring-Cosmos and the Ring-Chaos, spinning at right angles to each other. The Ring-Cosmos is a disk, the Ring-Chaos is a ring outside the disk at right angles to the plane in which the disk spins—all, as our text says, to the nearest approximate metaphor. (“These images are not descriptive but symbolic…”) Once again we have a polarity, just as we did when space first started flowing…and once again the dinergy between the two opposed but unequal forces gives rise to something new.
In the metaphor Fortune uses, “something new” is represented by movement. What happens, in the metaphor, is that the Ring-Cosmos begins to pivot. Our text asks you to visualize the disk of the Ring-Cosmos as having an upper and a lower surface, and the upper surface on the outgoing arc (the first half of the original Ring-Cosmos, which it made by flowing away from its starting point) is attracted to the Ring-Chaos, while the lower surface is repelled by the Ring-Chaos; on the incoming arc, the attraction and repulsion are arranged the other way. This is metaphor, again, but it has quite a bit to teach; it’s not only in cosmological metaphors, after all, that every attraction is balanced by a repulsion and every repulsion by an attraction, and that these alternate at various points of any creative process.
I’ve found that some students have a hard time visualizing the third movement that results, so we’ll shift metaphors a bit. Imagine the Ring-Cosmos as a flat horizontal disk of metal. Imagine the Ring-Chaos as a ring of metal larger than the disk, positioned vertically so that the disk fits inside it, and the two touch at two points, where the ring passes just outside the disk. Imagine that the ring and the disk are connected at those two points by a pair of pins on which the disk can pivot. Now imagine the disk pivoting on those pins, one side rising up, the other dipping down, until the disk is in the same vertical plane as the ring—but the disk keeps pivoting, so that the side that rose is now dipping and that which dipped begins to rise. The disk moves faster and faster, and as it moves, its outer edge traces a sphere.
That sphere is the Ring-Pass-Not, the third of the Rings that define a Cosmos. The Ring-Cosmos is primary; the Ring-Chaos takes shape in response to it, as a function of the resistance of space; the Ring-Pass-Not takes shape out of the interaction between the other two rings, as a function of their mutual attraction and repulsion. Spend some time imagining the whole process as clearly as you can, all the way from the first movement of space to the formation of the Ring-Pass-Not. Then imagine it again, and think through each part of the text that describes the process, until you have some sense of how it all works.
Then apply what you’ve learned to something else—say, an interaction between two people. The Ring-Cosmos is set in motion by the initial action that brings them into contact. The Ring-Chaos is set in motion by the initial reaction to that first action. Over time, the interplay between action and reaction leads to the creation of a boundary—the Ring-Pass-Not—that defines the interplay between them. In the language of systems theory, these are action, reaction, and equilibrium; in the traditions of the Cabala, they are the three pillars of Force, Form, and Balance; in the symbolism of Masonry, they are the three pillars of Strength, Wisdom, and Beauty. Other symbolic systems have their own ways of talking about the same things.
It’s crucial to understand the relative roles of the Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos, and Fortune uses a deft bit of discussion to help you grasp that. The last paragraph of the chapter—in the Millennium Edition, this is the last paragraph on page 21, spilling over onto page 22—is the one to follow here. (In both, it begins “The secondary spin of the Ring-Pass-Not…”)  Here Fortune assigns several descriptive labels to the Ring-Chaos. It’s the prime stillness of the cosmos; it’s the thrust-block that resists the force of the Cosmos; finally, it’s the Prime Evil.
The pun here (“primeval”) is quite deliberate, of course, but so is the moral reference. From within the boundary of the Ring-Pass-Not, the Ring-Chaos represents everything the Cosmos is not; it represents the primal void out of which the Cosmos takes shape. It represents these things, but it is not these things. The Ring-Chaos, remember, comes into being after the Ring-Cosmos, and in relation to it. It is the reaction to its action, the pushback of the Unmanifest against that first movement of flowing space and everything that unfolds from it.
That pushback is also the original form of what we call evil. The question of evil has bedeviled philosophers for a very long time. It’s especially challenging for thinkers who are committed to those monotheist faiths that claim the universe was created by one and only one almighty, omniscient, and infinitely loving deity; a vast number of unsatisfactory arguments have been deployed to try to explain why such a deity would have created a world as well-stocked with misery and brutality as the one we experience. The Cosmic Doctrine, as we’ll see, does not posit such a deity, but it also proposes a distinctive vision of the purpose of evil.
Evil, in Fortune’s account, is a thrust-block. It’s the thing we resist and push off from in order to go somewhere else and do something else.  The nature of evil, and the ways that the initiate uses it as a way to get traction, will be discussed in quite a bit more detail in the chapters ahead, and this will also involve an exploration of the difference between evil as inertia (“negative evil”) and evil as actions on the part of conscious entities that follow the current of the Ring-Chaos rather than the Ring-Cosmos (“positive evil”). The point to take away at this point is that evil is the friction exerted by the Unmanifest, the resistance that allows action to happen.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you do this, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on July 11. Until then, have at it!

Readers might want to check their local library.  I was pleased to discover that mine offers the book online for forty days at no cost through a service called Hoopla.

This very alien framework for thought will not throw a wrench in whatever we are studying? In my case, the Celtic Golden Dawn system?

Liz, glad to hear it. 
Packshaud, no, not at all. Fortune was working in the Golden Dawn tradition, and her philosophy is entirely compatible with it.







 Patrick Conroy says:

Is it too early to ask about determinism, i.e. whether the interaction of the Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos can only be the one thing that arises from the details of their formation? Or, perhaps, does non-determinism arise from the freedom/randomness implied by the unknowable Unmanifest that underlies their creation? But perhaps this is jumping ahead too fast and is in any case too system-mechanical at this stage of description…







 OtterGirl says:

Piggybacking on Packshaud’s question, is the Cosmic Doctrine also compatible with BOTA studies?







 orathbone says:

As the ring cosmos is spinning around even as it spins within the sphere chaos presumably the point of ‘contact’ between the two rings is forever changing

Though what I’m writing appears to be offtopic, (I hope) it is not.
For a while I have been thinking on how meditation works. My current understanding of it works like this: if I try to learn some lesson by rote–in a certain place I should not mention the mages used to call it spoonfeeding–such as “eating more calories than you burn will increase your weight,” you accept this is your conscious mind, but it doesn’t become a part of your behavior. For this to happen, you have to “live the lesson,” so that it is learned by the unconscious.
Another problem is that negative imagery is not absorved well by the unconscious mind. It seems to have no concept of “not.” In fact, contemplating negative consequences will have the opposite effect, making you imitate the imagery.
Meditation then is a carefully structured set of symbols for the unconsciois mind, made by people who know very well what they are doing, that teach a lesson in a way that makes it to be “lived” so that it “clicks” and it is integrated by the unconscious and assimilated into its behavior. Like what is made in CosDoc.
This is sounding quite rationalistic. I could have wrote about syncing with mental plane patterns, but I have an old habit to try to present, erm, woowoo in scientific terms to avoid spooking people (and in the beginning, myself).
Now I have to take a detour, with a problem related to the Celtic Golden Dawn. My progress has been slow, because often I feel the need to make a separate meditation session on some point that appears, sometimes related to the older lessons (I am at the second meditation on the stone for days, and I keep getting insights from it). These stray points are deeply related to the themes but way off the curriculum; an example is that post on the elementals, fae, and humans that I made on the last Magic Monday.
I have been dealing lately with the way the cycle of Air–Fire–Water–Earth works. I mean, how Fire transitions into Water and so on. I attempted to analise it in terms of the temperature and humidity of the elements. I have noticed that temperature connects to Fire and humidity is related to Water. There are some problems with this approach, but I have a strong feeling that the “rings polarities” of this first chapter in CosDoc are a key to the solution. Which brings me again at Fortune dropping out of the sky to help me with something I was struggling with, like in the case of that thing about the fairies.

I sometimes like to use thinking about complexity theory and weird physics as a kind of secular mysticism. It’s so different from what you normally think about it puts you into a mild altered state of conciousness. The things she’s talking about here are a lot like the things that come into my mind when I’m thinking like that.
I may be taking this in a different way than was intended but the bit about dealing with evil by surrounding it with a vacuum reminded me of something. I was researching how we go about getting rid of things we don’t want and the examples I looked at included organised crime task forces, weapons inspectors, and the eradication of smallpox. Part of the smallpox campaign was whenever somebody was found with the disease everyone who had any contact with them or just lived nearby was automatically vaccinated. So regardless of whether the patient lived or died the virus had nowhere to go. It was called ‘ring vaccination’. It’s got me wondering what other ways that basic concept could be used.

Patrick, we’ll get to that. In Fortune’s account, the cosmos starts out more or less deterministic due to its sheer simplicity, but as it becomes more complex, in much the same terms as presented by modern chaos theory, complexity leads to feedback loops and to the generation of genuine novelty and spontaneity. Fortune discusses this at length using the term “epigenesis,” and we’ll be exploring that repeatedly as we proceed. 
OtterGirl, as far as I know, it should be fine. If you’re a member of BOTA, you might want to contact someone with a detailed knowledge of the system (which I don’t have — I was a correspondence student at one time, but that was many years ago) and ask their opinion about the compatibility of BOTA with Dion Fortune’s work. 
Orathbone, yes, from within, in terms of the contents of the disk and the ring. Seen from outside, the points of contact appear fixed. It’s like a highway that crosses a river on a bridge. The water is constantly changing and so is the traffic, but their relative positions and courses remain the same. 
Packshaud, good. Very good, in fact. There are no prizes for rushing through the meditations; quite the contrary, the more thoroughly you pursue the work, the more you’ll get out of it.
Yorkshire, as we’ll see further on, there are some remarkable parallels between Fortune’s account in The Cosmic Doctrine and such modern disciplines as systems theory, complexity theory, and chaos theory, so the similarity isn’t accidental! As for ring vaccination, it’s a little further ahead in the book, but Fortune discusses the constructive way of responding to evil in almost identical terms. Thus you’re definitely on to something…

Belts and disks and spheres, oh my! This is dense stuff for sure. I haven’t read Cosmic Doctrine before, but remember trying to get my mind around all of this when Gareth Knight explains it in A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism. It’s been a long time since I read that, so I’ll go back and review his thoughts on the matter as well. My desire to place these ideas in the context of a story kept bringing Ananke and the protogenoi to mind, but eventually as I tried to stick to the more abstract conceptualization, I thought of something different. As I was reading Fortune’s postulation of the secondary motion of the disk, and I’m not sure I am thoroughly following, I was reminded of the on-again-off-again retrogrades of the moon’s nodes. I’m not sure this metaphor would hold up to scrutiny, but I’ll play with it to find out. Certainly from a simplistic comparison the Sun’s ecliptic and Moon’s trajectory at an angle to it, and the two touch points of the nodes bear a passing resemblance to Fortune’s image. Thanks infinitely for guiding us through this! –Joy

I will have to work with this material more before I have much to say, but one thing that struck me about these three rotations is that they are duplicated in (one version of) the Circulation of Light which closes the Sphere of Protection, so that will give me a bit more to think about in terms of the symbolism of that ritual.
Also, I can’t really figure out what’s up with “the Logos as a Sun surrounded by His Solar System of Planets and of the emanations of the Logos as Rays,” which was just kind of popped into my edition after the introduction of the Unmanifest as interstellar space; she goes on immediately to say that the Unmanifest is the only Unity, and the Logos seems to be presented as a male symbol, and thus half of a duality, although the female pole is not really mentioned. I would presume the Earth would represent the female pole if the Sun represents the male, their union engendering life, but I may just be making stuff up. And, er, I won’t go into precisely the imagery that came to mind about the Rays as “emanations” of the Logos following this train of thought…
Additionally, I detect echoes of “the great I AM” when she says of the Unmanifest “IT IS”–which reminds me also of God moving upon the face of the waters vs. the prime duality being space and movement. God as the Unimanifest as a Unity before dualities were manifest (echoes of Genesis here). I haven’t brought this together yet in my mind, but I feel as if there’s a thread to follow.

That was decidedly no jog in the park, yet … the subject matter itself is so foundational to my existential cravings, that it was worth the toil. I appreciate your introduction – I’m not sure I’d have soldiered through without the sense of community.  The main source of frustration stemmed from my personal limitations in visualising the geometry in 3D. I got lost after the 12 rays …. struggling with whether these were spokes from the central hub of the first circle, or rather were spokes of the spherical shape created by rotating circles 1 and 2. Having lost that battle … I let go into the feeling of the all-encompassing awesome scope, and sweep of the subject matter, happy to recognise several pieces I had intuited even as a school-boy such as the structural relationship between atoms and solar systems.  I enjoyed putting a rock on the Big Bang theory too – it never resonated. I’ll have to spend more time on the visualisation piece.

Please feel free to delete this comment if it is confusing or irrelevant.  
It popped into my head that the Unmanifest compares to potential energy.  Also, it occurred to me to think of it as the medium in which all things happen.  When I looked into the etymology of the word medium, I found out that it literally means “middle” from its Latin root.  So not only is a medium a word for the material an artist, composer, or writer uses (Fortune’s image of interstellar space is a blank canvas and paints) but also “the middle quality between two extremes, a reasonable balance”.  This brings to mind idealistic sayings about returning to the center, the middle being home base, or the centering of oneself, or the story of the prodigal son returning to his family, a.k.a. another rabbit hole. My question, which I hope makes sense: if the Unmanifest is the medium of potential, then should we think of the Unmanifest as the only arena where all possibilities exist?

As a chemist the dinergy concept rings true.  Electrons and protons have opposite charges of equal value but there is a giant difference in mass between electrons and protons.  Electrons have only a tiny fraction of the mass of a proton and hence can be move much faster in any electric or magnetic field.  So the structure of atoms  is the result of the interplay of the  opposite charges and unequal masses of electrons and protons. 
When I was visualizing the formation of the ring chaos I noticed that there are two different ways the ring chaos can rotate in relation to the way the ring cosmos rotates.  The ring pass not is in the same place (is this ring rotating? My visualization is static for the ring pass not,  a spherical shell. ) but there are two different mirror images that I can visualize for the rotating ring cosmos and rotating ring chaos.  Are they equivalent?

For this to happen, you have to “live the lesson,” so that it is learned by the unconscious.”
I’ve found that in many ways as well, most notably, for me, with directions. It’s almost impossible for me to follow verbal instructions on how to get to a place if they’re more complicated than “go down this street right here and take a left.” I have to physically go there a time or three, and ideally (given time and leisure) to get lost often enough that I know the surrounding area pretty well too.
Likewise, at work, a lot of the things I make mistakes in when setting up File X to upload become much clearer once I actually start doing the uploading and correcting the result.
More directly relevant: as someone who has a lot of trouble translating descriptions to images once motion is involved (the hardest scenes for me to write are fighting and sex), this was a fascinating challenge, and I’ll have to go back through and keep trying. The current impression I get is something like a tilty gyroscope–is that too far off?
(I also really like the idea of evil, or at least non-conscious evil, as a thrust block, which I mostly can conceive of as the pool wall during my dubiously-successful swimming lessons. :P)

Much in these first few paragraphs seems to fit well with my conceptual understanding of physics. At the time of my blog post (https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=99430), I hadn’t done much esoteric study. This fractal duality has been stewing in my mind since but I haven’t seen much practical use for it yet. I’ve also started to see folding patterns in many things although I’m not sure what it implies either. Thank you for starting this series in alchemical philosophy — hopefully I’ll be able to better understand the things I’ve been seeing.

								June 13, 2018 at 8:25 pm							




Fascinating, I very much enjoyed the mental images thus produced… though there is a bit of a glitch for me between the formation of the first cosmic disk and the subsequent chaos disk; when I try to picture in the tension drag ‘lines’ perpendicular to the first disk’s circumference want to form equally around the entire circumference, such that if they are extended to ring the entire first disk and right angles the first implication is like so many lines of longitude. I can by force have them to all be at a pair of opposed points on the first disks circumference and for a single meridian ring of chaos to be just outside of the equatorial disk of order; but this move has a distinctly artificial sensation about it. There is moderate luck by having the point where ‘the bridge goes over the water’ being positioned relative to a so called point of first motion.
Still the sensation of ‘drag’ or friction acting on the first ring from the second ring is palpable enough once I form that image. The feel of that drag torquing the cosmic disk up and over, turning relative to the ring, also feels fleshy enough. Interestingly, there are eddies at the points when the disk and ring cross, and ‘splashes’ when the disk flips through the ring. Perhaps I will need to edit those back, depending on where the image is to go next, but I am rather keen on the ‘splashes’ as the disk crosses through the ring and they, repeated they give a sort of periodicity to the image as a whole. While the periodicity of the disk or ring completing its own rotation (such that the needle on the vinyl is back to the same point) gives each contrasting periodicity, but it is more localized to the “water or the pedestrian” at the bridge again. Then the splash as for a moment the circuit the bridge is a part of is parallel to the flowing moat of the river.
Thus there are now, with out factoring in eddies and their ilk, a period native to cosmos, chaos, and pass-not (but which side of that sphere is the Balrog stuck on?). And it is conceivable for those periods to related to each other at any of a vast complex of ratios. Those periods being different we again face a unequality, and my mind is drawn toward a well worn path to a little mental grove where I have been trying to marry Bateson’s definition of information ‘a difference that makes a difference’ with a way of thinking about entropy as ‘indifference’… but I haven’t found the words for the vows to take place, and much further with out more thoughtfulness than I can manage at this moment would risk going too far afield from this weeks post.

I am sure that there is value in training 3D visioning … that its a core element in the training perhaps, but … it would be wonderful to have someone make a CAD model of the flows because I’m not good enough at translating the words into satisfying mental pictures. Even a couple of diagrams would help. Just how those 12 rays find their locations and then give rise to the 7 whatsits is not clear to me. Or … is it supposed to all flow from the meditation starting with “finding” that one basic movement of space?

Dear JMG,
At first blush, this style of reading reminds me very much of studying a physics textbook as I did in college. Each time I encountered a new equation, I would have to sit and contemplate how it was derived and what it implied.
I always joke that getting a degree in physics was a mind altering experience…I suspect properly understanding the Cosmic Doctrine may be similarly so.

The thing that started coming to mind was regarding magic. So in order to manifest something, would one have to apply a greater desire for momentum than that related to one’s goal, because a reactive force of inertia will be what pulls that arc down? Or at least, one would have to use those landing points, if one falls short of one’s goal, to push further towards that goal. If you can only work so much change because resistance is going to push back on your efforts, you need to be willing to break the process down and make sure you have the time to do so.

I’m so very glad that we are going to proceed so slowly. When my copy first arrived, I gave the first chapter a quick read just to get the feel, and my brain made great whanging noises, as some glimpses seemed to make intuitive sense, others seemed totally opaque, and still others seemed full of potential but like they might take me forever to unpack. I was feeling a bit anxious that I had spent a week on paragraph 3 (“The Unmanifest is pure existence…”) and still felt nowhere near done with it. After reading this post and the early comments, I’m reassured that that’s not a bad thing.
The image of the two interacting forces, the stronger and the weaker, producing a curve which eventually, over great time/space, returns to its origin, grabbed at me in a way I can’t explain. I literally held my breath for a moment and things went still, and then my palms tingled and my mind started racing with examples. This is the clearest experience I’ve yet had that sometimes, symbolic images are communicating with a part of my brain that isn’t the normal conscious level. Two tidbits I’ve gleaned in relation to this image are an appreciation for tiny changes and the (very) long game. Less powerful forces can still steer vastly more powerful ones, given the proper perspective. [Also, my determination to avoid letting advertising images into my brain as much as possible is renewed- I do not want them talking to my unconscious while my conscious attention is turned.]
It’s good that I’ll get much more practice with visualization while working through this text. In imagining the three spinning disks/rings, I do just fine with one at a time, or even (kind of) two, but just as when I visualize the Circulation of the Light in the Sphere of Protection, three is really hard, and in fact I think I just toggle back and forth quickly between different permutations of two planes of movement. I am not giving up hope that this is something I can develop, but as my spatial sense is not my strong suit in any regard (I’m terrible at navigation, for example, as I struggle to make mental maps), I’m going to be going through JMG’s descriptive commentary daily to try and push through this barrier. (Or is there a better metaphor to think about this difficulty with?)
Lastly, JMG, will the comments on this post stay open throughout the month rather than close off at the end of the week when a new post goes up?
Thanks for this challenge, and the support in meeting it-

I’m curious about the use of a few words and how to understand them. Might you be able to shed a little light on them (not so much definitions but further analogies)?
First is “planes.” In Intro II, the text says, “Transmitting images in colour and form upon the second plane…” and “but transmitting ideas upon the third plane” and it goes on to talk about the “transmission of messages from one plane to another…” 
 – I wonder if planes in this context is akin to planes as imaged in the Ring Cosmos and if that differs from or is the same as the planes referred to elsewhere (etheric, astral, etc.).
The next is “Logos” imaged as a sun. By Logos should we include in our conception the notions of Word, logic, order? That’s what “logos” calls up for me (admittedly a superficial basis of understanding it) but there’s probably more? Or is it best just to stick with the images given without going into concepts not yet introduced?
Thank you!

I apologize if this went through already. Technical difficulties. (I frequently have intermittent internet out here.)
I read the first two chapters last week. Interestingly enough, my visualization of the Ring Cosmos and the Ring Chaos were as you have described. However, the image I developed of the third movement that creates the Ring-Pass-Not was more akin to the arcs of a magnetic field coming off the Ring Cosmos and creating a sphere. I think because of the reference Fortune makes to the surfaces, upper and lower, of the outflowing and inflowing arc, I imagined a flat circle with an upper and lower surface. So that instead of a true sphere, the Ring Cosmos I have visualized was something more like a spherical fat donut with currents flowing over the surface being pulled up and down toward the Ring Chaos. Clearly I need to spend more time on my visualization. As I re-read your explanation, I found myself moving my hands in response to your description to assist with my visualizations. Now I have both images, my original and the one you provided. (And the whole thing is faintly reminiscent of the Circulation of Light in the SoP with the three movements of the sphere, or the three spheres with different spins that merge during the ritual which is sometimes how I see it.)
Thank you! This is going to be fascinating for me.

Packshaud, re: compatibility between the Celtic Golden Dawn and the Cosmic Doctrine, if you look at the introduction of some symbolic shapes in middle of Ovate Knowledge Lecture 3, you might notice some particularly specific parallels with the material in first few pages of the CosDoc. I just did, at least.
JMG, I’ll be following along on this journey. I have two questions right now:
— Is it okay to post questions regarding CosDoc all month long here, or just in the week until a new Ecosophia post appears? I ask because if we process the text at the rate you’ve suggested, many of the times that it occurs to us to discuss something will happen on a non-book club week. If this happens, shall we just take note of it, and save it for the next book club post?
— What rate are you planning on taking this book? If we do a chapter a month, that will take us nearly three years. (This is not a complaint, just an observation.)

Joy, excellent! You can also see it in terms of the intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic, or (if you’re into Plato) the two circuits of the Same and the Other from the Timaeus — I suspect this latter is directly ancestral to the Cos. Doc. 
Jen, the reference to the Solar Logos et al. is intended to hint at some of the themes in the chapters to come; you don’t need to follow it up now, though you certainly can if you want to. As for IT IS, there’s a specific Cabalistic reference here; in ancient Hebrew, the holiest name of the Jewish god, YHVH, is the third person singular of the verb “to be” — “he is,” “she is,” or “it is.” That’s distinct from the name AHIH, “I Am.” There are various Cabalistic bread crumbs dropped here and there in the Cos. Doc., and this is one of them. (Notice, though, the difference between conventional notions of the Judeo-Christian god and the Unmanifest as Fortune describes it…) 
Marco, whoa, Nelly! If you’re reading about the rays already, you’re going way too fast; it’s no wonder you’re having trouble making sense of the imagery. Stop, back up, and spend the next month working with the assigned reading given in the post — yes, just those three pages. It takes that kind of investment of time to make sense of it. 
Kimberly, it’s neither confusing nor irrelevant; it’s a good point. Yes, exactly: the Unmanifest is the foundation on which all apparent existence arises; all possibilities exist within it, and there is nothing outside it. Again, think of it as space. Can you imagine anything as being outside of infinite space? (Try it sometime; at best, all you’ll get is a mental image of more space that’s somehow detached from the rest of space.) Just as all things exist in space, all possibilities exist in the Unmanifest, as appearances and becomings. 
Jim, good. Yes, they’re equivalent, or to put it another way, they provide equally good metaphors. 
Christopher, glad to hear it. 
Dale, thanks for this. I suspect that the interface between fractal mathematics and the implied systems theory of the Cosmic Doctrine will lead to some very interesting places; I haven’t studied fractals enough to be able to pursue that, nor do I have a background in physics, so your reflections will be of personal interest to me. 
Ray, excellent! Yes, the metaphor requires a bit of artificiality here and there, and the generation of the Ring-Chaos from the Ring-Cosmos is one of the places where that happens. I suspect a less artificial image would be much more difficult to imagine! As for the Balrog, we’ll get to that — seriously! The short form is that the Balrog is outside the Ring-Pass-Not; he’s the thrust-block that enabled Gandalf the Grey to make the transition to Gandalf the White Rider, of course. 
Marco, here again, you’re going way too fast, and failing to put the necessary time into building up the images and thinking about them, so of course you’re getting things bollixed up. Spend a month working with the genesis of the Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos, and Ring-Pass-Not, and after that you can build the other aspects of the system onto that one patient step at a time. 
Ms. Krieger, an education in physics is also intended to train the mind rather than to inform it, so I’m not at all surprised you notice the similarity! 
Jean-Pierre, excellent. You get today’s gold star for working through the metaphor and drawing some good practical conclusions from it. 
Heather, delighted to hear it. Yes, the comments page will stay open for the next month, and I’ll make a point of continuing to respond to comments here until the next Cos. Doc. post goes up. 
Temporaryreality, I’m not at all fond of the introductions to the Millennium Edition, because they presume the reader is already familiar with the concepts covered in the text. We’ll be getting to the Planes and to the Logos as we proceed. Until then, I’d encourage you to bracket those concepts — treat them as you would the X or Y in an algebraic equation, until it’s time for us to discuss their definition under the appropriate images. 
Yanocoches, the rotation of the Ring-Cosmos relative to the Ring-Chaos will be important in later parts of the text, which is why it’s useful to get a clear sense of the Ring-Pass-Not as the sphere traced by the outer edge of the Ring-Cosmos as it pivots around its intersections with the Ring-Chaos. Glad to hear you’re enjoying the ride!







 John Michael Greer says: 



								June 14, 2018 at 12:13 am							




Quin, nice catch. 😉 As for your questions, I’ll be fielding comments here for the next month, and we’ll be taking at least three years to unpack the Cos. Doc. — it really does take that long to work through it properly, if you want to get everything out of it that it has to offer. 
Deborah, good. Keep in mind that Dion Fortune was a Golden Dawn initiate and a very serious student of the Hermetic Cabala; when you find apparent references like that, why, yes, she very likely intended them.

The part about defeating evil, not by opposing it but by “putting it in a vaccuum”, reminds me of my attempts to ignore my salivation (among other things) when meditating, or attempts to go from breathing manually to breathing automatically. To focus on fighting the issue is to focus on the issue, thus preventing it from becoming a non-issue.
Also, I don’t think it’s relevant to the metaphor (for now at least), but it occurs to me that as the Ring-Cosmos pivots around, it comes into alignment with the plane of the Ring-Chaos, sometimes in such a way that the direction of their flows also happens to coincide, sometimes in such a way that they’re going in opposite directions.

 Oleg S. says: 



								June 14, 2018 at 1:16 am							




Dear JMG,
When thinking about Unmanifest I was imagining data analysis. The raw data (Unmanifest) has no meaning and cannot be understood. The first mental tool to understand the data is to seek for cyclical patterns, hence Ring-Cosmos. I cannot imagine more primal tool for analysis. Then Ring-Chaos arises when the data don’t fit into pattern and changes unexpectedly. The mind then tries to organize these changes and looks for cyclical patterns within patterns, hence evolution of Ring-Cosmos. This repeats many times and Ring-Pass-Not is formed, the limitation of these methods of finding cyclical patterns in chaotic data.
Is this interpretation valid?

After finally understanding the way the ring cosmos and the ring of chaos form the ring pass not, it reminds me a bit of the classic astronaut training apparatus you see in science fairs. Also, is the way these rings turn in any way related ir similar to the way one circulates the light of the Cross in the SoP? My understanding is that the vertical line spins forward to create what would be the ring cosmos, then the left to right line spins counter clockwise like an airplane propeller, creating the ring of chaos, then, they start to turn to the left around the vertical axis of the body, creating the sphere of the ring pass not. How accurate is this picture?
Thanks as always!

JMG,
Thanks, I didn’t realize that; I’m afraid my Biblical knowledge is pretty much confined to the version bequeathed to us by good old King James. And certainly it would never occur to me to visualize the Judeo-Christian God as interstellar space!
I find that I can visualize clearly the current of space slowly bending infinitesimally under the influence of the two opposing forces until it returns to its origin. I can also envision the Ring-Chaos after it is formed, and, with your explanation, the pivot that defines the Ring-Pass-Not. What I have trouble with is the formation of the Ring-Chaos: “The spinning in one plane continues until the stresses which it generates evoke a new movement, and a second current in space is set up at right angles to the first.” I don’t grasp what stress causes the second current to begin at right angles to the first; it seems as if the first should just continue to accrete indefinitely. Is it this way purely for symbolic reasons? Or am I missing something about the (pseudo)physical forces we are imagining?

Okay, I was only able to read part of the reading from an online source that would not go past page 20. So if these questions were explained in the text, pardon my asking. 
So far I get that there is a cosmic ‘plate’, a chaos ‘ring’, and a spherical boundary defined by the flippin’, trippin’ and dippin’ plate motivated by attraction/repulsion ‘forces’ that belong to the top and base of the plate with respect to the ring. Roughly like a gyroscope toy, but with the additional ‘magnetic polar’ flippin’ and dippin’ spin added in. (Nifty toy idea. Mattel, are you listening?)
So, does the ‘plate’ behave more like a solid disk of vinyl, all areas moving at the same speed and in the same direction (deosil? widdershins?) connected together? 
Or is there ‘slippage’ with inner bands of the disc turning at a faster rate and outer bands turning more slowly, as if the disc might be like the Rings of Saturn, not connected, just spinning more or less in unison but generally a little out of sync? Or even concentric rings spinning in bands of alternating deosil and widdershin motions (as I once saw a flight of hawks doing in the air above a meadow!) ? 
Or is the disc motion like the spiralling of a vortex – –  though not one of Dissipation, so abhorred by Jane Austen, but more like a squashed hurricane? 
And if the disc has any of these styles of motion (vinyl, bands, spiral) then why don’t the Chaos Ring turning at right angles develop the same properties, so that you have two intersecting discs like two spiral galaxies cutting through each other, getting thoroughly tangled and messing up each other’s preferred form of motion? 
Whew! That’s enough questions for now. My image muscles are aching.

Archdruid,
Against the backdrop of potential.
Desire builds to a great flow of energy, resisted very weakly by will. The will-not-to being the strongest force of will there is, but weak against sufficiently powerful desire.
There is friction against potential as the two great forces, desire and will, pull and push against each other in a great arc. The Ring-cosmos.
Around the edges there is light. First repulsed by will, then drawn by desire, till the light meets itself. The point of meeting is consciousness, and consciousness is chaos. The Ring-Chaos. It does not know what to do with itself, it does not know what it is. Yet, it is there.
The ring-pass-not…yeah, still working on that.  
Regards,
Varun

I read in an interpretation of the Cos. Doc. that the Ring Chaos was larger than the Ring Cosmos, which would have the Ring Chaos passing through the sphere defined by Ring Pass Not at various points. That would explain the Balrog theory above, as well as the extension of that theory, the “Door of Night” from the Silmarillion, in that the forces of the Unmanifest can make it through the Ring Pass-Not at a few very specific points. 
Yet the Cos. Doc. itself doesn’t mention this – the rings appear to be of equal size and nothing can go beyond the sphere of the Ring Pass-Not. 
Are you able to elaborate?

JMG and all,
Oh how relieved I am that we are going to take a nice long time to thoroughly explore this! 
I have had a similar experience to packshaud’s- my meditations will often generate additional related points to consider. I can’t always tell how many sessions a particular theme will require to be fully, or at least satisfactorily examined. Which to be honest, kind of scares my control freaky, “everything needs to be on a schedule” self. (Which is a theme I am meditating on currently – meditating on parts of the practice that are irksome or elicit a negative reaction can yield a lot of information! Sometimes unwelcome, always useful…). 
Anyways, back to the point – it’s really great to be participating with others in a non-competitive space in such a way that taking my time in getting into the depths is encouraged. 
Thanks for that, everyone!
Bonnie

Valenzuela, excellent! Yes, that’s a good example, and yes, the rotation of the Ring-Cosmos into and out of the plane of the Ring-Chaos will be relevant as we proceed. 
KF, fascinating. That hadn’t occurred to me. 
Oleg, don’t worry about whether it’s valid. This is metaphor, remember, and a metaphor is neither valid nor invalid; the question to ask is whether it’s useful, and your interpretation certainly seems useful to me. 
JP, when I first learned the Sphere of Protection, I was startled enough by the similarities to the Cos. Doc. that I asked my teacher whether there was a connection. He insisted that there wasn’t — but it does look very similar! 
Heather, yes. The Ring-Pass-Not is the boundary between the space marked out by the Ring-Cosmos as it pivots, and the space outside it, which is subject to the Ring-Chaos. 
Jen, it’s a metaphor, and that bit is arbitrary. Just assume that for some reason it does so. 
Gkb, because it doesn’t. 😉 Again, remember that this is all a metaphor, and is intended to communicate certain specific things. We’ll be getting into the internal structure of the Ring-Cosmos in a couple of months. 
Varun, good. Keep working. You’ve got a whole month…
Peter, er, I take it you didn’t read the text. If you did, I’d encourage you to go back and read it  again. The Ring-Chaos is larger than the Ring-Cosmos — the Cos. Doc. says this in so many words — and is outside the Ring-Cosmos, therefore the Ring-Chaos does not pass through the Ring-Cosmos — it is entirely outside the outer edge of the Ring-Cosmos. Since the Ring-Pass-Not is the sphere defined by the outer edge of the Ring-Cosmos as it pivots, the Ring-Chaos doesn’t pass through the Ring-Pass-Not, either — that’s half of why it’s called the Ring-Pass-Not (and not, say, the Ring-Only-Pass-Through-In-Certain-Places).
Nor, of course, was Fortune commenting on Tolkien, or (for that matter) Tolkien commenting on Fortune — I’m pretty sure that C.S. Lewis read some of Fortune’s writings, as there are things in his planetary trilogy that echo her ideas pretty precisely, but I know of no evidence that Tolkien did anything of the kind. 
Varun, nope. The Ring-Pass-Not is the boundary of the whole system. Outside it is only whirling void. For beings within a cosmos, what is outside the Ring-Pass-Not can’t even be imagined. 
Bonnie, you’re welcome and thank you. I’m really impressed by the quality of the comments so far!

JMG,
I managed to get a copy of the book in the mail this Monday and sat down with excitement to read the first chapter.  As the introduction noted, I tried my best to allow the words to convey an image into my mind.  I felt good about it but then came back to it the next night and as reading it and after reading it all I allowed my mind to follow the images that were being described.  Perhaps because I had seen an image of yin and yang in the shape of a sphere and in which the points which were yin within yang and yang within yin flowed as a current, like positive to negative, I kept seeing this image in my head.  It was a struggle to imagine it more disk shaped which I did manage on the second night.  The next day, which would be today, tons of connections were flooding my mind, like the irony in my current job within the health care industry which has a great deal of the employees guzzling sodas and energy drinks left and right, and who are far from the picture of health advising people on the phones about their health insurance. 
 I connected my upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness, where they refer to their doctrine as The Truth, and my departure from this organization because I was interested in finding a spirituality which had better clarity in it’s answers for why things happened leading me to the occult.  
In the USA at least, I know a fair number of people born between the 30s to the 50s.  Many have a very developed sense of work ethic.  No work, no games.  Many of their children, or grandchildren, who are in their 30s to 50s are quite content with the idea of no games, no work.  Using this model has helped me to make sense of a lot of the oddities I see around us.
There are, oddly as it may seem, a huge amount of polarities in this world.  Often one faction of the polarity destroys the other but then another opportunity for the creation of another opposing faction results.  It did leave me wondering whether or not we’ll be reading about achieving some sort of balance between the polarities.  I also was left wondering just how many things in our life are seemingly paradoxical.

Well, rats, I’m somehow disappointed that there’s no connection between Cos Doc and the Sphere of Protection. It seems so intuitive. Oh well, hopefully dedicated practice in imagining the motion involved will benefit both strands of thought for me.

“as you picture them are imagination” – they are not imagination… just as you picture them…  
A disarming double bind.  Things are not as you imagine them to be, and will not be as you imagine them.  They can only be experienced, and the experience will train the mind rather then inform it.  A scary submission of will for a western mage seeking control or mastery, eerily eastern.

I’m still on “the Unmanifest is pure existence.” There is a lot packed into that deceptively simple phrase, and I’ve been considering it throughout the day. A close reading reveals a lot packed in here. At this point I will not write all the questions and ideas that spring to mind, but (leaving aside the problem of whether you can say the Unmanifest “is” anything, that is, formulate an identity about the unknowable) is this saying that the manifest, by contrast, is impure? And what sullies or dilutes pure existence? Time? Experience? Consciousness? (The Fall?) (Is the Tarot trump of The Fool implicit here?) Is an impure existence made of lesser existence-stuff? How can some things “be” less? 
I begin to suspect that your reading of Sartre was not coincidental…
P.S. Years ago I learned close reading from a professor who had us spend quite a bit of time on unpacking “Call me Ishmael” You have to be really patient with certain types of text, although it is quite fun.

Hilarious that the Balrog joke actually is a point of traction, I meant it as a bit of empty silliness. Earlier today I used one of my favorite quotes, on the silliness “If people never did silly things nothing intelligent would ever get done.” – Ludwig Wittgenstein; which in a way brings me back to the usefulness of evil as a jumping off point for, say transformation, or if you please getting something intelligent done. The other thing I am remembering about evil is that according to a preponderance of folk lore any evil worth its salt cannot be destroyed, at best it can be banished in a sufficiently through manner.
It is ever so interesting that the Prime Evil is outside of the Pass-Not, a response to the Discworld, and yet already outside of the Pass-not; unimaginable to the beings of the Cosmos, who still can push off of it to transform. Much like the unmanifest being 1 thing that for many a practical purpose seems like nothing, the Prime Evil is a big baddie yet inconceivable; it isn’t present, isn’t here, isn’t this or that, it just drags on, Zarathustra’s spirit of Gravity. The Balrog was a vague being in the book to say the least, much like the villain Sauron; who was ominously resisting Middle Earth but never present. I wonder if those eddies I mentioned earlier where the ring and disk are are their closest (where drag most readily pulls across the Pass-Not) are the Positive Evil. That positive evil in its meekest form is, I think the silliness that Wittgenstein was on about. Beings in the cosmos whose form is a part of the drag of the manifest, the constant friction acting on the manifest, represented, reality. In silliness we let in a little meek inoculation of evil into our midst to play with; that unpredictable still waters which are always outside of our ordered existence, ever prone to resist our motions, and inscrutable. Of course, once that silliness becomes serious, a being can be a manifestation of that drag, giving it agency. Apoptosis and Resentment.
If one were interested in a theodicy concerning the problem of evil, I doubt a better job could be done that building on this role that evil plays in this philosophy as a necessary point of counter tension to the prime movement; a pot stirrer one might say. Which is almost precisely what Sauron’s old boss was described as being by JRR, who I imagine was more interested than the average bear in theodicy.

Prizm, glad to see the book is doing its job and inspiring thought! It very often takes a while to grasp some of the imagery, which is why a month is a good time to spend on each chapter. 
Heather, there’s no direct lineal connection. You can still make a connection! 
RedRed, good. That’s actually something that’s part of traditional Western occultism — take it from me, it’s at least as scary to be sitting for the first time in the anteroom of a lodge, waiting for your first-ever initiation ritual, knowing that you have absolutely no control over what you’re about to experience and still deciding to go through with it! The extent to which that’s been lost in modern Western occultism is a sign of imbalance, because mastery can only be learned by submission, just as submission takes a great deal of mastery…
Berserker, excellent! Yes, exactly — there’s a vast amount to be unpacked even from the relatively simple statements in the book, (Especially from the relatively simple statements…)

It has been interesting to see the things that jump out and grab different readers’ attention, or cause the most confusion. For me, visualization comes very easy, so I had no problem seeing the rings and their relative movements, but in a way this is its own handicap, because if I had had to wrestle more with that aspect, it might have brought forth other insights. I *see* it, yet I still feel there’s so much left to unpack.
Meanwhile some of Fortune’s other ideas that pique my curiosity: First is where Fortune says, “The first manifestation was a current in space,” and “All I can say is that space was moving. You will find these clues are a clue to much.” This makes me think of how many different cultures have symbolized the Unmanifest as water–which is, I think, probably the easiest metaphor for imagining a “space” that is/has movement. So it brought to mind the way that, according to the Heliopolitan Egyptian cosmogenesis, the primordial water (which as I understand it is what Fortune calls the Unmanifest) sort of coalesced and formed light, Atum-Ra, symbolized by a (solar) disk. Indeed Atum is often depicted surrounded by Nun (the Unmanifest) in the form of a ring. But I think this may lead into what Fortune is going to say about the Logos, so I’ll wait for that. I get the sense there are nested layers like a matryoshka doll where the symbols are reiterated–or at least rhyme–at different scales. I also begin to understand how you can see through the different metaphors used by different cultures to the shared patterns underneath.
The second thing that grabbed me is where she writes, “the whole of evolution turns upon the difference in size between the planes.” Why should this be? I hope Fortune will go into it more. I’m not entirely sure what she means by “evolution,” although I would guess based on this first chapter that it’s something along the lines of increasing complexification of manifestation. It seems to parallel the idea of the two unequal forces of desire-for-movement and desire-for-inertia. A difference in their relative strength was necessary to allow the original movement to manifest as a curve that becomes a ring that becomes a disk that becomes a sphere, so maybe the difference in relative size of the planes is working in a similar way? I shall try to meditate on this.

 (Heaven and earth

At this moment I am not sure whether to think of the Ring-Cosmos / Ring-Chaos as analogous to the Ying-Yang, or to think of the Ring-Chaos as the edge of the Ying-Yang and the Ying-Yang within the Ring-Cosmos or don’t make any analogy at all.

I am a bit vague about the out flowing and in flowing arc. Their possession of positive and negative charge, fits well enough with an above comment comparing the loophole of chaos’ right angle emanation from the prime movement of the cosmic whirl with the right hand rule of electromagnetism. The image can be embellished ever so slightly to be a functional diagram of a crude DC motor.
For the time being, supposing I use a cosmic clock face to imagine diskwhirld, could I suppose that 12-6, on the clock face, might be the out flowing arc, and 6-12 one could think of as the out flowing arc? That the side of the clock facing my perspective, call it the top, is positive therefore on the right side, and negative on the left, and that those charges, on the side of the clock facing the wall which we might call bottom are opposite to that.
Or is there something I am missing particular to my understanding of the out and in flowing of these circles?

JMG
It will take me more than a month to get my head round the interesting comments / replies as well as the text. I obtained the 1995 edition in the UK via AbeBooks less than a fortnight ago and read DF’s Introduction as well as Introduction II and Chapter 1. I have also dipped a bit further. Sound and music wait for me.
Your clear exposition helps considerably with visualization of the dynamic images in Chapter 1.
I was reassured in my earlier reading of the DF Introduction by the sanity of her musing on her, quote, going “baresark in my quest of the Masters”. Her description of personality in the quality of communication during her subsequent interview rang true enough. I liked ‘weary Jesus’, aka Most Holy Lord of Compassion. This set me off comparing her account fairly favourably with other communications from ‘entities’, whether these have been ‘Masters’, or whatever. Decades ago I was introduced by New Age friends to ‘channeled’ or “received teachings” to use DF’s phrase, and found wanting even the more worthy sounding ones. For want of a better term my ‘aesthetic’ sense was a good guide, and I gave up. On one occasion an anachronism in a supposedly factual account of a previous life was sufficient to trip me out of ‘suspension of disbelief’.  I have some thoughts in mind about DF’s ‘Masters’ and about ‘mastery’ and metaphors…but…  it’s my turn to muse… are the Masters also metaphors?
There were interesting asides from the DF Intro, including the contribution from the writing of Annie Besant initiating DF’s quest. That set me off thinking about Krishmnamurti. Likewise I was intrigued by the introduction of mystic Oliver Cromwell. And then the word ‘fluidic’ appeared from nowhere in Introduction II. That sent me off on a small memory quest of my own.  And I am trying to give my own answer to DF’s ‘riddle’, and incidentally why I am following this JMG monthly book discussion. Smile.
So, onto initiatory Chapter One: the words ‘centrifugal’ and ‘centripetal’ came to mind. My first efforts spun off into a reverie on time – that is time with a capital T. As a child I once experienced very briefly the vertigo of the void when actually lying under the field of stars and contemplating outer space. I guess the void can also be experienced when contemplating Time, as for example in death. My contemplation of time this last week, however, was more a matter of classifying the obvious. The experience of time in for example stories , or memory, is very different from other awareness, or so it seems to me. And I search for the role of personality as perhaps transcendent, both instant, changing and persistent.
I found ‘evil’ less difficult than I might have, having first absorbed a good while ago much of William Blake’s philosophy: e.g. his ‘Marriage of Heaven and Hell’. I have thought again of Defoe’s pithy remark about ‘necessity being the greatest evil’, which has its wisdom for human society.  And the facts of biology, predation and ecology are what they are, and as my mother called them, dumb animals cannot be evil in the human sense.
For what it’s worth I have gone back to Frances Yates and the dynamic mnemonic disc of Roger Lull and as FY put it, the ‘occultisation’ of this by Bruno in his ‘Shadows’. The turning of the ‘thrust block’ dynamic disc at right angles seems to have been missed by Bruno? 
Time is running away with me this morning!
best
Phil H

Forgive me if I’m mistaken, but there are some Christian analogs to the definitions.  I have heard that “Jehovah” is a way of saying, “The Becomer”, that is, he-who-is-continuously-becoming, unfolding.  Yahweh says to Moses that he is the “I Am.”  NOT the one who was and will be, NOT a being with a past and future, but he is the Everpresent Now, the stasis field, the Ether.   …And again, the Becomer, that which arises from the standing potential field.
The Logos, like “breath” (a thing fellow Inkling Owen Barfield wrote an entire book on) had a very wide meaning at the time it was written.  Logos is like the information.  In Plato, there is the real world and the theoretical, intangible, “heavenly” world.  If you have a chair, you also have the template for a chair.  But!  You can have the template for how to build a chair in your mind, with no chair anywhere on earth.  So which is more important, more real?  Oddly, it would seem the “Logos”, the information-chair, is more important, because you can make a thousand chairs from your knowledge.  However, following Plato, every ACTUAL chair will fall short of the IDEAL, which is one basis of saying the heaven is better and earth is a sort of hell.
For us modern types, Logos is like online information, existing nowhere in the cloud, which may or may not be used.  Its counterpoint is “Force”, that is, the expression of that information, the carving of the chair from the template, of the YouTube video being followed in your own workshop.  Logos is therefore order, it is the laws of physics that determine what can and can’t happen, and it’s the LIMITS of Logos that make it “Good.”  –A pivotal corollary when you extend “Logos” as the “Law,” the “Word made flesh,” and “Jesus Christ,” because saying “no, don’t do these things, they are evil/hurtful/counterproductive” is widely seen as hate and oppression right now instead of love in the sense of “don’t play with fire, in the road, with a cobra” (things might, just maybe! not turn out so well). 
So LIMITS are the basis of reality, in this dimension.  The lack of limits, restraint, rules, order — the banishment of Logos — is the path to madness, to psychosis, mass-murder and anti-life.
What is beyond the ring?  Well, we’re only talking our 3rd (or 4th dimension).  At the very least we suppose a number of dimensions that don’t follow these rules of behavior.  Surely THEY would be outside the ring, if following far wider rules of their own.
But in our world, and following the Buddhist line, we have the Void, and/or the Tao (which cannot be named), the one, which then splits into the two, and into the ten-thousand manifestations.  Why?  Because for any “thing” to happen, you need to be able to left AND right, up AND down.  And if you can become more good, more Logos, more orderly, then you MUST, by the laws of existence, be able to be LESS good, LESS orderly, or to use the word, “evil.”  For anything to happen, for good to be chosen, evil must exist.  If you want to stay in heaven where nothing can happen because it’s All-One-God-Faith, then there is no evil…because there are no ups, no downs, and no choices.  Not much of a story, that.  So I don’t see why people think God “creating” evil is a problem.  The instant the One-God splits/appears to split into two, there is “evil.”  …And Good remains dominant force because Chaos, like Sauron, eats itself, and Good unites and reinforces itself, and therefore always wins.  If not, there would be no story.

“IT (the Unmanifest) is the only reality”.  So nothing we perceive as reality in the material world is actually real.  We are in the Matrix.  Plato’s allegory of the cave comes to mind; no wonder most people don’t want to attempt to wrap their brains around it.  “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players,” suddenly takes on new meaning.

One general comment before I begin; I don’t remember ever posting an essay that has attracted so much serious contemplation from readers. Thank you, all of you; I’m feeling just now as though the decision to launch this particular Book Club series was a very good one. 
Ray, remember that the Prime Evil is the thrust-block to the entire cosmos, not specifically to the beings who emerge later on within the cosmos; as we’ll see, these grand patterns have echoes that cascade down to the level of the individual person. That said, Sauron’s a great example here, because he spends Tolkien’s entire trilogy off stage, a looming presence you never actually encounter. He’s outside the Ring-Cosmos of the story, and only appears by way of his servants — if you will, his reflections inside the Ring-Cosmos. (One of the things that makes so many Tolkien knockoffs so dreary, in turn, is that their cloned Dark Lords almost inevitably come capering on stage, so that the reader can see all too well that they’re bland little stick figures of evil…) 
Matt, you’re welcome. 
Alexandra, very good! I’m quite sure you’re right about water as a mythic symbol for the Unmanifest — I suppose you could just as well call the Unmanifest a philosophical symbol for the Primal Waters. And the matryoshka-doll quality of the Cos. Doc.’s cosmology is very explicit, as well as an essential key for unpacking the meanings of the text. As for evolution, that’s a complex concept to begin with, and Fortune’s using it in a nuanced way; we’ll be exploring it from various angles as this conversation continues. 
Carlos, the comparison’s by no means impossible. In the broadest, cosmological sense, the Ring-Cosmos is Yang, the Ring-Chaos Yin, and the Ring-Pass-Not the S-shaped line that divides and unites them in the familiar symbol. As we proceed, see how the comparison works for you. 
Marco, fair enough! The mighty four-letter word of power RTFM — since this is a family-friendly blog, we’ll translate that as “Read The Fabulous Manual” — is at least as important in magic as it is in anything else. 
Ray, no, you’ve got it. Now imagine your clock face lying horizontally. From just outside the 12, a current of space flows upward, curves, and descends, passing just outside the 6; it then plunges below the clock face, curves, and comes back up to complete the circuit just outside the 12. This becomes the Ring-Chaos. The half of the clock face between 12 and 6, on one side of the Ring-Chaos, then begins to pivot upwards, and the half between 6 and 12 accordingly pivots downwards, until the clock face is rotating around an axis that extends from 12 to 6, and the sphere that it traces out in this rotation is the Ring-Pass-Not. 
Michael, you’re welcome and thank you. 
Phil, the whole question of “the Masters” and the source of The Cosmic Doctrine is a tangled one, not least because of the far from helpful influence of all those channeled entities you mention. That’s one of the reasons I like to start the Cos. Doc. from Chapter 1, plunging right into the text, without spending time on the introductory material. Are the Masters metaphors? Are they simply the framing devices Fortune had to use in the context of her time to get people to pay attention to her text, the same way that the founders of the Golden Dawn had to cook up all that folderol about a Cipher Manuscript and a nonexistent German adept, and Gerald Gardner had to pretend to have gotten his New Religion out of a coven in the Old Forest? Are they a way of talking about the experience that most authors have at one time or another, of a book basically downloading itself into your brain from parts unknown, and demanding to be written? Or is she describing what actually happened? Those are fascinating questions, but the Cos. Doc. doesn’t depend on the answers for its importance. 
Jasper, of course there are Christian analogues, and you’ll find specific references to certain aspects of Christian teaching as we proceed. Dion Fortune was a devout if heterodox Christian — she drew a sharp distinction between Jesus the person and Christ the cosmic principle, which IIRC would have gotten her burnt at the stake not too many centuries ago — who, like a great many Christian esotericists before and since, saw no contradiction between praying to Christ and invoking the Pagan gods and goddesses of nature. More broadly,  your comments about limitation as the foundation of existence are spot on; we’ll be talking about that in much more detail as we proceed to later chapters. Fortune would have agreed with you heartily about the problems with the notion that all limitation is wrong; the attraction of outer space — the craving for limitlessness — was in her view, and is in mine, one of the great driving forces of positive evil. 
Marco, thanks for this. 
Kimberly, good. There’s a lot of Plato here and there in the Cos. Doc.!

The taoist myth of Pan Gu is an almost exact parallel of Fortune’s account of creation.
“Long, long ago—not in a land before time, but a time before land—there was nothing in the universe except an enormous egg-shaped entity.
Inside the “egg,” the opposite forces of yin and yang were all scrambled; it was a complete mess. But over time, the interactions between various substances and energies eventually conceived a being—a shaggy, horned giant named Pan Gu.
For 18,000 years, Pan Gu (pan goo) slept and grew. One day, he suddenly awoke. He opened his eyes, but saw only pitch-blackness. He strained his ears, but heard only unnerving silence. Pan Gu found his dreary surroundings highly disturbing.
Flustered, Pan Gu conjured a magical ax and landed upon the egg a mighty chop. The egg split into two with a thunderous crack. Slowly, yin and yang began to separate. Everything dark and heavy sank down to form the Earth. And the rest, light and clear, drifted up to form the heavens.
But Pan Gu was anxious that the halves would close up again, and so he stood between the two halves to keep them apart. With each passing day, the sky rose 10 feet further above him, the Earth thickened 10 feet below him, and Pan Gu himself grew 10 feet just to keep up with the growing expanse and hold on.”

The egg is of course the unmanifest, eggs being a symbol of potential. Yin and Yang are the Ring-Chaos and Ring-Cosmos (I don’t know which is which) and Pan Gu the Ring-Pass-Not

I am baby stepping my way through this visualization.  I am focusing on getting the imagery right before intensively pairing the visualization with the text.
For me I am visualizing the ring cosmos as a clock on the desk in front of me and it is moving clock wise (of course).  I imagine the pivot points for the intersection of ring cosmos and ring chaos at 12 and 6.
For me, I started out visualizing ring chaos not at 90 degrees to the clock face but at a much smaller angle.   In my mind I start ring chaos out a few inches above the 9 and I have the ring chaos move clock wise (in the same direction as ring cosmos)  it dives through the plane of  ring cosmos at 12 o’clock and comes back up through the plane at 6 o’clock.  The whole time it moves in the same direction as ring cosmos.  
Then, because I know that ring chaos could  also move in a counter clock wise fashion (while ring cosmos is still only going clock wise) I tried to visualize this combination of motion.  And honestly it was a bit more difficult, I think because they are going in opposite direction.  
Then I returned to the easier visualization of the ring chaos at a small angle and moving clock wise, and I increased the angle until I got to 90 degrees with no problem.  After 90 degrees I was back to more difficult visualization with the rings moving in different directions.
I understand what I am visualizing is slightly different from the exercise outlined, I am rotating the plane of  ring chaos around and keeping ring cosmos flat on the table, rather than rotating the plane of ring cosmos and keeping ring chaos at 90 degrees.  It is an easier visualization for me but I am guessing I should work on visualizing both ways.
Should I be paying more time and attention to the things that are more difficult to visualize?

This bit is bugging me:
“As new senses open up, more planes of existence can be known. There is, however, a limit to the knowledge of the finite. Perception ceases at the barrier of manifestation. Of that which lies beyond we can only know by analogy. The Unmanifest is pure existence.” 
I quote the rest for context, but namely, “a limit to the knowledge of the finite” followed by the assertion that we cannot know anything beyond manifestation, which seems to imply that the Unmanifest is itself finite (although unknowable), which seems incorrect. The image of interstellar space implies infinity; although, as of the last astrophysics class I took, there is some debate about whether actual space is infinite or not, as you (JMG)  said in another comment, it is hard to imagine anything beyond/outside of space except more space somehow divided from the rest. I want to read this as “our knowledge is limited to the finite,” which seems to make more sense, and would make the Unmanifest both unknowable and infinite, but that doesn’t quite seem to fit Fortune’s actual words.

Dear JMG,
Having encountered some snippets of modern physics, I find it very difficult to imagine the unmanifest as an empty void of interstellar space. My mind gets inevitably distracted by the visible cracks in this simple vision of endless emptiness as soon as I remember that space has it own intangible properties, and thus cannot be considered truly Unmanifest. Some such property – the topology of the Cosmic Arena – is able to make the picture incompatible with what is drawn in the first chapter of Cosmic Doctrine. Imagine Ring Cosmos formed on a toral surface: the dynamics of Ring Cosmos and Ring Chaos would be completely different. There would be no Ring-Pass-Not because Ring Cosmos would be unable to complete its revolution. On a surface of a torus, there would be no option to form a disk, instead, there would be different streams, isolated from each other, and of different qualities. And this is only one of many ways space could be organized. There are countless other possibilities, some even more strange. I’m thinking of eternal inflation, a great number of dimensions, interconnectedness between space and time, to name just a few.
Of course, I understand that by imagining all these other pictures I may completely miss the point of the exercise. But I wonder if sneaking a common-sense notion of 3D Euclidean space into a model for the most basic knowable, for good and evil, for order and chaos, might lead to some disaster in the future.

								June 14, 2018 at 8:51 pm							




If the Unmanifest is a great stillness, of the potentiality of all possible being, and the manifest is a great movement, of change and of specific becoming,  does the Unmanifest lose a quality that is being manifest and re-absorb the experience of that quality when it becomes, again, Unmanifest?
This is chewy stuff! My brain hasn’t worked this hard since an undergraduate course on Heidegger. I am glad I am not the only one struggling to visualise the planes and angles of movement being describe so thank you for the additional imagery.

Got the pdf. Thanks Marco!
Clarification, please: the spinning + flipping cosmos defines the sphere of Pass-Not. But the Ring-Chaos ALSO rotates making a sphere outside that? So its spin is like a flowing band of river, and its rotation is around a Polar Axis at a 90 degree angle to the original plane of the cosmos (which by now is flipping and no longer stays put in that plane?). Oy. I am not sure about the second sphere’s motion, see.

JMG, due to your essay “On Occult literature” on May 30, this old agnostic has decided to take the plunge and join in with the study of the Cosmic Doctrine.  I don’t have anything specific to ask or comment on, since, after reading through the comments and questions, along with your answers, I have found everything (so far!) that I have wondered about addressed.  I am also glad that you plan on keeping this post thread open for further comments and questions all month, since I’m sure there will be more to learn and ponder upon with multiple readings of the text.  Perhaps this will assist me in getting a good solid grip on the world and the forces that flow through it.

So, according to this great whirling metaphor, every action generates its own reaction from the wider world, and that reaction attracts and repels the original action. The interaction between the action and reaction then defines and sets limits on their relationship. 
The idea that there are no straight lines in the cosmos, is this partly a commentary on how life generally unfolds? Nothing seems to go straight towards a purpose, but meanders in some direction, even if there’s someone driving it.







 temporaryreality says: 



								June 14, 2018 at 11:28 pm							




On a mundane and personal level, the image of Unmanifest/space undertaking movement counteracted by slightly less equivalent inertia is applicable to my (current) life’s tendency toward act and then release-of-act (or purposeful and purposeless moment/momentum) with a slow swing back around to those things needing further action, not square one, but spiralled back around. At least there’s a natural pattern there and at least I do come back around eventually, though I do need to practice not letting aeons lapse between revisits.
I’m mulling some questions over and when I reach the limits of my heretofore untrained at “unpacking” mind’s ability to sense, suss, or feel its way further, will pose them here.
Fun, chewy stuff!

								June 14, 2018 at 11:39 pm							




Jim, the exercises you’re doing are great for building your capacity to visualize, but in order to make sense of the text, you should probably visualize the specific images that the text asks you to visualize…
Jen, this is one of the reasons I prefer the revised edition. Here’s how that same passage reads there: “As new senses open up more planes of existence can be known. There is, however, a limit to the knowledge possible — the finite. Perception ceases at the barrier of manifestation. Of that which lies beyond we can know only by analogy.” That is, the Unmanifest isn’t finite; manifestation is finite. We can thus know manifestation directly, but we can know the Unmanifest only by analogy.  I suspect the version in the Millennium Edition is a bit of bad editing, as it makes no sense in the context of the teaching! 
Oleg, yes, you’re missing the point of the exercise. “These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are designed to train the mind, not to inform it.” If Fortune had wanted to use Lobachevskian or Riemannian space, say, for her metaphor, she would have — those were already being discussed by cosmologists before the Cos. Doc. was written, and we know from her essays that she kept up with quite a few branches of science. Since this is a metaphor, not a description, and since the point of the imagery is to train your mind to think in ways that it’s not used to thinking, the question is simply whether you want to learn what the text has to teach; if so, bracket the geometrical complexities and follow along. 
Waterworks, the Unmanifest has no qualities — “a state of pure ‘being’, without qualities and without history’ — so it can’t lose any. How do qualities come into being out the Unmanifest? The same way anything else does — a current flows in space and forms what we may as well call a Ring-Quality, its movement generates an orthogonal Ring-Absence-Of-Quality, and the pivoting of the first ring in response to the second generates a Ring-Pass-Not. Yes, you can apply this same logic in many other contexts!
Patricia, good heavens! Sorry to hear this. Energy for a prompt recovery on its way. 
Just Me, you’re welcome and thank you. I know the feeling — there’s a lot of crass nonsense out there in the occult field. 
Gkb, our text is just a bit evasive about the movement of the Ring-Chaos, but it seems to work best to think of it as stationary, the static thrust-block against which the movements of the Ring-Cosmos push off. 
Rabbter, hmm! I’ll have to look into that.

Dear JMG, your mention of CS Lewis’ Cosmic Trilogy is timely, since I was going to ask you whether we should imagine interstellar space in a ‘modern’ way (utter darkness, emptyness) or as Lewis does in Out of the Silent Planet and in the Discarded Image, quoting the Ptolemaic and medieval cosmos, and envision it full of Light. I have to admit the former is somehow easier for me, to imagine darkness to start with, and then just enough light to feel the movement and ‘see’ the rings forming… Loads of work here indeed, particularly for someone with a weak point at visualizing…, glad you’re leading us at this pace!

I’m a bit confused here:
“From within the boundary of the Ring-Pass-Not, the Ring-Chaos represents everything the Cosmos is not; it represents the primal void out of which the Cosmos takes shape.”
The picture I got was of a cosmos-disk spinning within the ring chaos, which completely surrounds the cosmos disk. And the Pass-Not is simply the boundary of this disk as it spins, which outlines a sphere, but that sphere should be identical to the boundary of the disk itself, which is contained inside the Ring-Chaos. But above you seem to say the Ring-Chaos is inside the boundary of the Pass-Not.
I am/was having some trouble seeing inertia as evil, since it seem to be the resting state of the unmanifest, which is existence itself.
(I have been pondering for some years the mystery of existence itself, and it does make sense to say that the unmanifest is existence itself, so this is interesting.)
And the unmanifest is supposed to have no characteristics, but a tendency toward inertia might be called a characteristic.
But if it takes an overcoming of inertia to get a universe to manifest, as Paul LaViolette writes in Subquantum Kinetics, then I could see that as one way to look at it.
On a more personal level, there was a situation between me and another person that involved that person engaging in rather extreme and unpredictable inertia that ultimately frustrated me to the point I became utterly overwhelmed with rage, and I think may even have been a final straw that led to my health issue.
I had never thought of negative evil, or how destructive inertia can be when action is called for and when other people depend on you doing your part. Child neglect might be another form of it.

Reading the assigned portion several times tonight, and I really will have to delve into it deeper to truly understand it of course, I was reminded very forcefully of the Hermetic Cabala, especially concerning the Sephiroth being comprised of various Angelic and and Qlippothic components. If I’m on the right track, the RIng-Cosmos would be Angelic and the Ring-Chaos would then be Qlippothic and the interactions between the two is then something of an anatomy and physiology lesson on the Sephiroth, which she is visualizing being held together by various fixed forces, like an atom’s nucleus.  If this is the case, she is elucidating in breath-taking manner, describing exactly how and why a Sephira is spherical and defining it in terms of its own internal tensions and forces.   If I’m understanding correctly, Dion Fortune implies that the Ring-Chaos may be older than the first, which fits very neatly with the Cabalist idea that the Qlippoth are remnants of an earlier created universe.  I am very curious to see where she goes with this; the text gives off a very numinous feeling.

								June 15, 2018 at 4:46 am							




Manuel, Fortune’s starting from the modern idea of space, so imagine it as dark and empty.  Yes, it takes some work, but it gets easier as you practice. 
Jen, I’ve got a publisher looking into bringing out a new printing of the revised edition — I’ll keep everyone informed. Since this project is going to take us around three years, if things work out, you’ll be able to get your hands on the revised edition while we’re still at work. 
Onething, nah, I’m not saying that the Ring-Chaos is inside the Ring-Pass-Not. I’m saying that if you’re inside the Ring-Pass-Not, as of course you are, the Ring-Chaos, which is outside, represents to you everything that’s outside. As for evil, what we’re talking about at this point is negative evil, the kind of evil that expresses itself as inertia; later on we’ll get to positive evil, which is much more active. 
And no, as you see, your comment didn’t get lost! 
Justin, you can use drawings if it helps you picture the images in your mind. It’s the picturing in your mind that’s the important part, though, so don’t let the drawings replace your imagination!
Wesley, thank you! That’s good to hear. 
Violet, as you’d expect from Dion Fortune, there’s Cabala all through the Cos. Doc., but it’s not always there in a simple or straightforward manner. In a certain sense — and only in a certain sense — the movement that creates the Ring-Cosmos is the phase of Withdrawal; the movement that creates the Ring-Chaos is the phase of the Primal Worlds; and the movement that creates the Ring-Pass-Not is the phase of the descending light. The analogy can be taken too far, but it’s worth exploring.

The idea that unequal forces produce a curve, beauty and functionality makes me think of  longbows and katanas. Both are constructed so the outside and inside curves have different properties. Though here it’s the other way round, where the curve and the different material of each side (sapwood/heartwood and different hardnesses of steel) produce, and absorb, unequal forces.
There was a Horizon documentary that illustrated how the vacuum of space isn’t really nothing. It showed the closest we can get to nothing on earth – inside NASA’s vacuum test chamber. The commentary said “This is nothing. But it’s ‘nothing’ in three dimensions; ‘nothing’ through which light passes.” So if you were outside the Ring-Pass-Not in complete nothing you wouldn’t be able to see the rings from a distance because in nothing there is no distance. In fact you wouldn’t be able to see it at all because light wouldn’t be able to pass through nothing to your eyes. This doesn’t need to affect the metaphor or the visualisation, although it did give me the idea of trying to imagine standing on the Ring Cosmos or Ring Chaos, looking up and seeing the other spinning above you. It does demonstrate how hard it is to think of true nothing and questions whether such a thing can exist in the conventional sense.

Hi John Michael,
This is a gift, it comes with the price of work! Your riddle from last week is now resolved. It is a privilege, and an obligation that you present us with. I must scramble to get a copy of the book. I find screen reading to be tiresome for my eyes.
The winter has arrived here with a thud. It is 37’F outside right now and the wind is howling and the rain is coming in waves. Last evening a hungry wombat was out in the rain in the orchard. They can generally rest in their burrows for three nights if conditions are sub optimal (i.e. wet), but three nights of rain have now passed and it continues to rain. From a deep time perspective, this area that I live in was once dominated by blackwood (Acacia Melanoxylon) rainforest, and the tall eucalyptus trees battle it out with the wet/dry adapted rainforest species for supremacy. It is interesting to watch them duke it out.
My old blog is now dead and deleted. Gone. But a phoenix arises from the ashes! Anyway, I like the new blog better than the old blog! Hehe! Sometimes it does not pay to sit still.
Cheers

JMG
Thanks for reply. I understand your going straight into the philosophy as it is made available in the images. OK, we have got “received teachings” out of the way. 
I am not sure, however about DF’s own knowledge base. She says upfront in Intro that she has made no special study of this branch of esoteric science and the ideas herein, “… and have only the most elementary knowledge of physics and none whatever of mathematics.” My comment is that despite what seems sincere protestation (and I would need to describe similarly my own elementary knowledge base), 2nd hand knowledge and ideas especially in our modern semi-educated world, float around and manifest in our minds and conversations, and become part of vocabulary.
As you say, DF could use the idea of evolution in ‘nuanced’ ways. JMG quote: “As for evolution, that’s a complex concept to begin with, and Fortune’s using it in a nuanced way; we’ll be exploring it from various angles as this conversation continues”. My guess for what it is worth is that hierarchy comes into DF’s understanding of evolution because that was the way it was commonly discussed in the first half of 20th Century. Traditional Christian religion presumably was not the only tradition to struggle with interpretation of evolution, let alone with the idea of deep time. And the first globalisation had brought from elsewhere well-worked ideas on void, existence and time.  And goodness knows how newly verified aspects of quantum theory were filtering into meditation and contemplation back in her day? 
So the boat has sailed. And we venture beyond the present scientific method and the reach of the tools of classical logic and humdrum inference that normally circumscribe an arena for imagination. We extend rather the role of metaphor. That which we can see, that which we can reliably infer and can submit to logic and consistency of intelligible exposition, needs to proceed more by analogy and metaphor if we are to find useful limits to reality. JMG quote:“…the attraction of outer space — the craving for limitlessness — was in her view, and is in mine, one of the great driving forces of positive evil.” 
I admit to being lost about ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ evil. 
Change, direction, intention, wishes, cravings, priority, and the others as they come in and out of existence…
Ray Wharton above quoted: “Of that which lies beyond we can only know by analogy” D.F.
And Ray added: “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof must one be silent.” Wittgenstein T.L.P.
I suppose we can look among analogies for constructive metaphors and if it is possible, their verification?

“Evolution is a thrust from the surface towards the center.
Devolution, or Dissolution is a suction into outer space.”
This is very interesting almost a reversed schema of the abred -ceugant model. Thinking of evolution as going toward a point, as contracting or converging, has for a good while been antithetical to my thinking; on the other hand thinking of dissolution as an outward suction toward a perimeter of incomprehensible chaos seems less foreign. Though the evolution of a given being in manifestation could be going toward a certain track in the cosmic-vinyl; as the center is a trackless point to any particular being, being the center of all Creation as such (Creation in this sense being identified with the ring-cosmic, not with Being Beyond; the Heavens in this way of thinking)
The chaos-belt, which exists out side of the manifest world, as a sucking vortex drawing outwards, makes me thing of each radii of the Ring-Cosmic as a chain of being, so that the needle might move toward the center; such that it is closer -on average in the spacial metaphore and in connection in a more systemic metaphor- to the whole of the Ring-Cosmic; or it might more toward the outer limits and exist in an world where only a tiny hinter-bit is close to it, too far from the center to perceive the cosmic forces acting upon it, but instead swung by the turbulence of the Ring-chaos’ inscrutable wonkiness.
I suppose that there is a reasonable compromise between my afore acquired method of thought of evolution progressing toward a wide range of options, and this new central focused schema thus: It is the RING-Cosmos not quite a disk. That is to say at the center of the windy need tracks of all created being is still a circle of great diameter, but from the chaotic static of omni possibility beyond this is still small, and can be seen in the empirical case of convergent evolution. Such that out of many more possibilities there are a comparatively few forms that are converged upon at the climax of various tracks… before that form in its maturity is again acted upon by aging-chaos, a different kind from the thrust block chaos.

So, if Unmanifest is “to be” turned back on itself, and anything existing in interstellar space that we can measure because we know interstellar space is not empty, is manifested stuff, can we consider Unmanifest to be the Black Swan that our human capabilities cannot fathom? Even though these unfathomables can and will have great influence in some way at some time?  And what we are practicing here is new senses or organs of sense that will allow us access to what hitherto remains hidden to us?  Like the inklings we learn about dark matter?  And is knowing dark matter is unmeasureable it is manifest and therefore not unmanifest?

It has been mentioned that Fig. 1 of the Ring Cosmos can be perceived in two different ways.  The standard way, for physics teachers at least, is to see the left arrow on the lower arc as in front, and the right arrow on the upper arc as in back, thus we are looking at the top surface of the ring rotating clockwise.  This is how I saw the Ring Cosmos.
Fortune later describes the upper surface of the outflowing arc as positive and this is depicted in Fig. 4.  The left side upper surface of the Ring Cosmos is labeled as positive.  I was confused, this would be the inflowing arc. 
And then I saw things from a different angle.  The right arrow on the upper arc could be in front and I was looking at the bottom surface of the ring.  Had Fortune already altered my perspective?
There are facts, for example Fig 1, and the explanation thereof.  The facts can be perceived from different angles and two observers, given the same facts, may disagree on the explanation.
It also occurred to me that the two observers, one seeing the top surface and the other the bottom surface, would both say that the rotation is clockwise, yet clockwise from a bottom view is really counterclockwise from a top view.  Perceived agreement may not mean actual agreement.
JMG, thank you.

Would like some further clarification on the difference between philosophy and occult philosophy. I suspect non-occult philosophers think that their work too is “meant to teach you how to think in ways that don’t come naturally to the untrained mind.” The difference, I suppose, is in the kind of “training” we are talking about? Would it be correct to say that occult philosophical training entails essentially non-rational kinds of mental exercise? (Would it be fair to say “aesthetic” exercise?) 
Aside from this question, I confess I am experiencing strong feelings of resistance to this book. Largely because decades ago I undertook mystical (?) work like this with high hopes, but eventually decided that the particular school I was involved in was mostly about squeezing ever escalating fees out of its adherents and ensuring their docile loyalty to the guru. Obviously, you aren’t trying to do anything similar here. But old disappointments and resentments linger.

JMG, a reprint of the revised edition sounds like a worthwhile endeavor. You can count on one purchaser at least!
Today I was thinking about this bit:
“It [the Unmanifest] is the only ` Reality’. It alone is substance. It alone is stable. All else is an appearance and a becoming.
It struck me as strange to refer to the Unmanifest as being “substance,” since this seems to imply materiality. But I conclude that Fortune is using “substance” to mean the undifferentiated primal stuff; when it enters manifestation, it differentiates and takes on qualities and history: “an appearance and a becoming”.
But then I was also bothered by the assertion that it was stable. Well, why did it start moving, then? And why does manifestation come about at all? I re-read the bit about the Ring-Cosmos forming, which Fortune says is caused by the “desire of space for momentum.” As for why it desires this, I got nothing, but it seems to indicate that the Unmanifest has a will in some sense.
Then it occurred to me that you can (albeit imperfectly) map the three Druid elements onto this picture: Calas being the substance of the Unmanifest, Gwyar its movement, and Nwyfre the life and will that makes it want to move in the first place.
I am not very clear on whether the rings, once they have formed, are in manifestation, or are just sort of…organized pieces of the Unmanifest floating around in more Unmanifest. We’re still dealing with pretty abstract analogy, so I’m thinking we haven’t reached actual, knowable manifestation yet, but my thinking in this area is rather fuzzy.

Before the beginning of time, God (well, the Unmanifest, but since it’s the Unmanifest, it can’t have any name that I give it, so I figure any name is as good as any other) felt his all-encompassing awesomeness, and desired for another consciousness with which to enter into relation in order to share that feeling.  So with the strength of its will it caused space to move; a giant exhaled breath of the intention which led to the differentiation or limitation which eventually becomes the Ring-Cosmos.  This is the movement away from God which led to the beginning of a new individuality.  (Since time did not exist before this moment, technically speaking one could consider creation to be happening at all times.  Actually, the same could be said about space).  At that moment of creation when time began, God noticed for the first time his own existence, since now there was another entity which had been differentiated from him which reflected him back to himself.  That was when he noticed he was lonely, as this new entity was something separate from him in a way which no other thing had ever been.  So God, with a powerful inhalation, exerted another force of will to try to draw the new individuality back to him, leading to the force that Dion’s calling the Ring-Chaos or inertia.  But I guess the new individuality also had a desire, to go forth and explore and exist as an individual separate from God, so the force of the Ring-Cosmos proved a little bit stronger.  Anyway, the interplay of these two forces led to the Ring-Cosmos starting to spin, filling with energy and becoming a new consciousness, a new universe unto itself, a sun, sephira (or individual human, for that matter); what is being called the Ring-Pass-Not.  Taking into consideration that well-known occult saying, ‘as above, so below,’ one might figure that it has its own creative power or will just like God has, so eventually it starts the process all over again, and it creates a new Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos and Ring-Pass-Not.  And so it continues, with the interaction of these two forces which leads to the creation of a third force taking place at a variety of different scales throughout all of existence, leading to the universe as we more or less know it.
The tendency of the newly created entity to go forth into space (the desire of space for momentum) would be the Qlippothic tendency, or what has been referred to as positive evil; a movement away from the Unmanifest.  The word ‘progress’ comes to mind here for some reason.  The force of inertia pulling back towards unity with the original God would be negative evil, or that force which exerts a drag on the will of the new individuality, trying to bring it back to the Great Negation and destroy it in a misguided attempt at affection on the part of God.   If the two forces were of equal power, nothing would happen, or more specifically they would cancel each other out, leaving us back at the Unmanifest, which, all things considered, seems pretty boring.  If the force of the Ring-Chaos didn’t pull it back a little, the new individuality would continue forever in one direction in a truly unlimited way, itself undifferentiated and undefined.  But it seems the universe doesn’t actually work that way, as instead there’s a unique balance, a tension between the two forces that leads to the creation of the third force at the boundary where they meet, the Ring-Pass-Not.   I always get the infinity symbol coming up at this stage of my meditation, even though it is not one of the images that Dion mentions.  
A question to which I have no answer:  is the Unmanifest a state of consciousness to which humans can aspire, after several lifetimes of the work of initiation?  Is it Kether? Or is that giving humanity way too much credit?   I suppose once a being attained the state of the Unmanifest, it would start all over again with the whole process of creation, so it may not matter much.
That’s my version of these first few pages; or at least how it occurred to me in meditation!  I would say there’s quite a lot of room for misunderstanding to occur though…

JMG,
The imagery got be thinking back to Mystery Teachings, specifically the 7th Law of Evolution, and more specifically the words: challenge, response, and reintegration. Taken over a long period of time, like evolution, one could experience a multitude of challenges, each one slightly altering the direction of something and forming a new ‘thing’ or ring-cosmos. That is then met with another challenge which prevents further development…a ring chaos that brings about a steady state of ring-pass-not…until another challenge…rinse and repeat.
Relating this to a “change of consciousness in accordance with will” I suspect one must continually throw these challenges (or primevils, maybe?) at the direction things are going to willfully steer things ever so slightly into the direction you want it to go. Taken over time, the thing or place you’re aiming for, could manifest itself, or, these multitudes of cosmoses can build an egregor.  It gets a little mushy and complex, so I’m now really starting to appreciate how the imagery and symbolism is so important to the “description.”  How the gods enter in, I’m not sure, but I’m guessing they lurk outside the ring-chaos. Perhaps they assist with the initial challenge.  As would a magical ceremony, I suspect.  Just one way I’ve looked at it…very much looking forward to the ongoing discussion and appreciate corner of the interwebs that you and your readers/commenters have carved out! Thank you.
Mike T

Hi JMG,
This esoteric piece of work has close resemblance to other essays I have read around the same topic. For instance, the discussion around ‘space’ and ‘movement’ closely parallels that of ‘akasha’ and ‘prana’. Here is an essay by Swami Vivekananda (Monist Philosopher from India) on this topic:
https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_1/Raja-Yoga/Prana
And the Trinity of Ring Cosmos, Ring Chaos and Ring-Pass-Not closely resemble Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu (in that order) — that of creation, destruction and sustenance. I think a relentless outpouring of creativity (e.g. Beethoven, Bach for the Western Classical Music – Tyagaraja, Muthuswamy Dikshitar and Syama Sastry for Carnatic classical music (South Indian tradition)) rely on tapping into this source (IT is the source from which all arises). 
Interested to see where the further reading of this work leads to.

Jen,
You were exploring this:
““It [the Unmanifest] is the only ` Reality’. It alone is substance. It alone is stable. All else is an appearance and a becoming.”
My understanding of this comes from discussion I’ve seen using the word ‘real’ (as opposed to illusion) in Hindu and perhaps Buddhist philosophy. That alone is real which does not change and does not depend upon anything else for its existence. All things which DO depend upon prior causes, are also changeable and subject to – oh boy I’m reading ahead a bit – evolution and dissolution. We of course think of something nice and solid like a chair as ‘real.’ But it is just another piece in the kaleidoscope. It has no ultimate and permanent substance.
Since the unmanifest is existence itself, that’s the rock bottom. It does not arise from prior causes and conditions. That of course is its ultimate mystery, a puzzle our brains cannot fathom, and one which atheists reject as a possibility.
But on that note I have had an insight. To me, God is that unmanifest, ultimate reality outside  causation. Atheists like Dawkins say such a thing cannot be. But yet,
1. They manage to believe in a universe whose causation is unexplained, and
2.  Even more, they ignore that the mystery of Existence Itself actually has two components to it, one being the unfathomableness of existence but the other is energy. Whence energy?
We are used to, in the back of our minds, a kind of understanding that all things come into being due to prior conditions, but where does the energy come from to power a universe? This is just as big a mystery as that anything exists at all.

The idea of two unequal but opposed forces has been faintly reminding me of something, and only just now have I been able to pin it down – the Golden Ratio. My modern mind wants everything nice and neat and symmetrical, but in studying sacred geometry I learned about this precisely balanced inequality that’s not really expressible in numbers, per se, but which allows the expression of great beauty.
Also, as I turn this stuff over in my head, I find I conflate the Unmanifest with the Ring-Chaos. Maybe because Fortune says that it represents the “prime stillness” for our Cosmos. And I suppose, if I imagine myself standing on the double-whirling Ring-Cosmos staring outwards, the Ring-Chaos appears to describe an immobile sphere interposed between the Unmanifest and the Ring-Pass-Not. 
So without an external viewpoint, it would seem that the Unmanifest is evil or chaotic, and I have to remind myself that this is just the layer between the Ring-Pass-Not and the Unmanifest (if I’m imagining this correctly).
Part of what boggles me is that the narrator is giving us a description of the metaphor from the outside-in, so that we start with several images of unknowable things. Then we come to the Ring-Pass-Not and a firm insistence that we can’t know anything about the unknowable things the narrator was just describing to us.
So on one level I’m still figuring out how to seriously grapple with this metaphor that keeps loudly insisting that it’s just a metaphor, and not to be taken literally.

Yorkshire, excellent! A katana makes a particularly good metaphor for the metaphor, because it’s straight before it gets its final tempering; a layer of clay is put along one side of the blade and not the other, and the differential in the speed of cooling causes the blade to take on its exquisite arc. 
Just Me, I gather the revised version is all over the internet at this point! Fascinating. 
Chris, I agree about screen reading — paper is just a lot easier on the eyes. I hope the winter isn’t too harsh! 
Phil, it’s quite possible that some of Fortune’s ideas were based on inaccurate science, but since all this is metaphorical anyway, that shouldn’t be too much of a problem. As for positive and negative evil, we’ll be exploring that in much more detail in the months ahead. 
Ray, good. In later chapters we’ll get into a much more nuanced vision of evolution, with a lot in common with Toynbee’s idea of growth through challenge and response. At this point the metaphor is being sketched out in only the most general terms. 
Larry, metaphorically, sure! 
CRPatino, hmm!  Yes, the link works.  That’s the revised edition, no question, but it gives the date of copyright as 1957. Clearly the history of publication is a bit more complicated than I’d thought. 
Peter, good. Keep that in mind as we proceed and see where it takes you. 
Dave, occultism refers to the specific traditions of magic and related arts practiced in the western world since ancient times, and suppressed first by organized Christianity and then by organized rationalism. Occult philosophy is simply that branch of philosophy that deals with occultism, and with the perspectives on the cosmos that come from experience with occultism. No doubt many other kinds of philosophy also include works that now and again try to teach unfamiliar kinds of thinking; the point I wanted to make was simply that all occult philosophy does so, not that no other philosophy does so. 
Jen, the rings are in manifestation, since they have qualities and history, but they’re a very, very basic form of manifestation, a long way from the richly complex form we’re used to. As for the rest, good; keep working with those ideas, and any others that occur to you. 
Stefania, we can aspire to the Unmanifest, but it’s not at all a good idea. No, it’s not Kether — quite the opposite. For us, within this particular cosmos, the Unmanifest is represented by the Ring-Chaos, which is the Prime Evil, and so to aspire to the Unmanifest — for us, and for other beings within the cosmos — is to aspire to the Prime Evil along the path of devolution. More on this as we proceed! 
Varun, the prime stillness is represented by the Ring-Chaos. It’s not actually still, but it’s as close as we can come — from within a cosmos — to the concept of stillness. The only real stillness is the Unmanifest. 
Mike, good! Challenge, response and reintegration — yes, those are another set of names for the three rings. As for the gods, no, they’re not outside the Ring-Chaos. Do you recall how, in most mythologies, the universe comes into being and then the gods are born? It’s the same way in the Cos. Doc. 
Laser_focus, those metaphors will work, too! 
Onething, excellent. Yes, that’s very much in tune with what Fortune is saying. 
Cliff, the Golden Section is a fine geometric example of what we’re discussing. As for the use of metaphor, that’s got layers within layers, and they’re quite deliberate. Partly Fortune is trying to fend off attempts at fundamentalism — she’d seen people go all dogmatic and literalist about Blavatsky’s writings, and threw in the discussion of metaphor to make that less likely. But there’s more to it than that, of course.

When I finally sat to read the first chapter with visualisations and got to the point of seeing the first movement of the Unmanifest, I saw something very different immediately – instead of the movement being circular and forming a ring it was toroidal, as in the whole space turning through a doughnut shape taking many different circular paths and all coming back to the same starting point. It was very vivid and had life on its own! In this image the Ring Chaos was a ring going through the middle of the doughnut and all around it. The image was quite difficult to shake off before I could force myself to see the shapes as described in the book and in this blog post. Very interesting!
It seems to be related to the image I had for electromagnetic fields that was drilled into me back in the uni days. It also corresponds heavily to how I saw the energy field of my body with middle pillar/central ray that goes through the central axis of the body being the shaft the toroid is wrapped around. Similar to this painting here: https://www.alexgrey.com/art/paintings/sacred-mirrors/alex_grey_15_spiritual_energy_system/
So far what came up while contemplating the material of the first chapter… Somehow it resembles the structure of a persona with Ring Pass-Not representing the ego and Ring Chaos – the shadow. And if it makes sense to see a structure of a person like that, then shadow as our tendency to say “I’m definitely not THAT” is the cornerstone of the whole construct!

‘There are facts’ … ‘The facts can be perceived from different angles and two observers, given the same facts, may disagree on the explanation’…
‘It also occurred to me that [for] the two observers’ … ’Perceived agreement may not mean actual agreement.’…
You JMG responded: ‘Peter, good. Keep that in mind as we proceed and see where it takes you.’
And Darkest Yorkshire cited some useful metaphors for the DF metaphor. You JMG liked the functional beauty of katana and responded: ‘A katana makes a particularly good metaphor for the metaphor. 
And then I was re-assembling a beautifully designed wooden scythe by means of its metal clamping  (The context was perfectly co-incidental; the scythe had been on my back while I biked to and fro to help with cutting grass for a coming theatrical performance by friends at a stone circle. The point being that ‘assembly’ of the tool was something I have not needed to do very often, and I was slow).  Not being perfect click-and-fit hard plastic, care and judgment was involved in tightening the clamped parts. It seemed like metaphor and awareness go together, and reminded me that our memory is not made of precise digital data-bases that can click and perfectly replay. Hmm…  I will see where it takes me!

@ JMG, thank you for clarification!  It has proven itself to be helpful for furthering my understanding.
Interesting to note, last night I went over the assigned text several times scrupulously imagining each image.  I did this until my head hurt, and soon fell asleep and dreamt abundantly and vividly.
This morning while doing the LBRP I noticed that the pentagrams remained in the air after I drew them it was uncanny, there they were, the drawn lines sparkling faintly.  I had caught some glimmerings of this, but this was a big change.  Doing my morning  discursive meditation I noticed that I was more easily able to concentrate.
Honestly I’m not sure this is effect is caused, at least in part, by contemplation of images that ” are not descriptive but symbolic, and are designed to train the mind, not to inform it,” or it is just a happy coincidence.  Nonetheless, it seems worthy of mention here.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								June 16, 2018 at 5:45 pm							




Stuart, it does indeed. One of the things I’m hoping to see here is people with many different levels of exposure to the Cos. Doc., from first-time readers to longtime students, sharing their insights, so it’s good to know that there are others here like me who’ve put plenty of time into it. 
Ganesh, to my mind Alex Grey is practically an anatomy-textbook illustrator when it comes to the subtle body, so where that’s concerned, you’re not far off. The Three Rings of the Cos. Doc., though, exist at a far more basic level — it’s only after we have the formation of a center and the development of the planes and rays that a toroidal geometry comes into play. Here it’s just circles and spheres! 
Phil, excellent. I don’t know enough about the manufacture of scythes to know how easily that could be made into a metaphor, but it seems like a good one potentially…
Violet, fascinating. See if the effect continues.

Well, after my first reading of The First Manifestation, I have to say: I’m quite puzzled, but in a good way. Though I had some trouble cottoning onto the points Fortune was trying to make at first, and worried that I would be unable to see the true meaning behind the text, I must admit that Fortune’s metaphorical model of a cosmos originated from the duality of space and motion in an uncaring Unmanifest is making a lot more sense than it did at first. In particular, the characterization of evil not as anything under human control, but the friction exerted by the Unmanifest against the creative energies of the Ring-Cosmos, simply another role played by the basic actors of force and inertia, makes perfect sense once you consider the roles of the Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos as action and reaction, respectively, and the way evil deeds tend to exploit good acts in the small snippet of the inner Ring-Pass-Not we call our home.
However, I do have one question related to The Cosmic Doctrine, and I hope it’s not too blatantly obvious: what are “Logos”, as Fortune defines them? I was unable to find anything related to them in the first chapter, or the first part of the succeeding one. If this is a metaphor, as it most certainly is, then I haven’t realized the true meaning.

Thank you to everyone for your comments so far. I understood the mental image pretty quickly after the original post but I was not sure what to do with it. It’s so different from other images I am more familiar with, like the simple image of light yang ascending towards heaven and dark yin descending to earth. For one thing we are not in a simple world of up-down or east-west, but in a complex realm of rotational movement and plane intersection. It was great to read everyone’s attempts to visualize this and put it into contexts familiar to them. This made my own image easier to meditate on as I thought about the simultaneous attraction and repulsion, and the moment of intersection. But I am still trying to get my head around how the Ring-Cosmos is formed in the first place, and how the Unmanifest differs from the Manifest (since the Unmanifest exists prior to difference). Hopefully I’ll have time to reread and contemplate this over the next month.

A couple of questions, which I hope won’t detract too much from the quality of the general discussion:
I understand that the Ring Chaos is spinning at a right angle to the Ring Cosmos but is it also rotating about an axis ( but in a direction opposite that of the the rotating/spinning Ring Cosmos)?  The text states that the Rings are mutually attracting and repelling, which to me suggests that they both have the capacity to rotate as they spin.  I’m picturing nested spheres here.
Second, the form that arises from the rotation of the spinning Ring Cosmos about its axis is a sphere.  Why is it not termed a “Sphere Pass Not”?  A Ring-Pass-Not seems, well, superable to a consciousness determined to go beyond it, whereas a Sphere permits no escape from any direction. Thinking of a Ring-Pass-Not causes my visualization to become static.  Furthermore, if it is simply a Ring, what is its orientation relative to the Ring Cosmos and Ring Chaos?  I feel that I’ve missed an important point somewhere.
Thanks for this opportunity

JMG re: Kether
Thanks very much for your reply.  That would put Kether right in the center of the three Rings, if I’m taking your meaning.   I’ll have to try to wrap my mind around that!  I’m getting a very strange image of the Tree of Life, made up of Matryoshka dolls, drawn by M.C. Escher…but I’m probably jumping ahead.
Today I went back to the line about training the mind, not informing it.  I visualized the three Rings as surrounding me (i.e. with myself as the center), where I imagine my aura to be, and got some interesting results.  I found I could still see it there later on in the day, outside of meditation.
I think the act of trying to visualize and hold such a complex image requires intense concentration, which is what could lead to the change in consciousness needed to actually start understanding what is being talked about in the book.  The regular mind isn’t going to be able to do it by just thinking about it.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								June 17, 2018 at 3:25 am							




Goran Kon, that’s not one of the works of Guenon’s that I’ve read, so I’ll have to leave that question to those who are familiar with both. 
Ethan, “Logos” is singular, “Logoi” is plural. (It’s a Greek word.) We’ll be discussing the generation of the Logoi in later chapters; here Fortune is dangling the term like bait. 
Avery, good! That’s one of the reasons why I want to take a month for each chapter. There’s a lot of meat to gnaw on. 
Dirtyboots, no, the Ring-Chaos is stationary. Imagine for a moment a magnet that’s moving, and another magnet that’s bolted to a wall. The magnet on the wall can still attract and repel the moving magnet, depending on which pole is turned toward it, without itself being able to move. As for the term “Ring-Pass-Not,” Fortune inherited it from the Theosophists; it’s actually a sphere, of course, but the term “Ring-Pass-Not” was firmly enough established in the occult jargon of her time that she pretty much had to use it. It also makes a neater verbal formula that way — the Three Rings sound better than the Two Rings And A Sphere. 😉
Hmm — “three rings for the Elven-kings…”  Probably not related, but if I ever wanted to pose a fine question on symbolism to students familiar with the Cos. Doc., I’d ask them to assign the rings Narya, Nenya, and Vilya to Fortune’s three rings, and justify their choice…







 Dirtyboots says: 



								June 17, 2018 at 4:16 am							




@Stefania,
I encountered the symbol for infinity as well, as an observer positioned on the Ring-Pass-Not watching the path of a random particle within the spinning, rotating Ring Cosmos.  Such a particle will follow a helical path that doubles back on itself.  This shape, projected in two dimensional space roughly approximates the infinity symbol.  Whether this signifies anything within this cosmogony I haven’t a clue but it provided great entertainment.

So, if Kether might represent the central point within the Ring Cosmos, then the current in space is the 2, Chokmah, tracing a line representing the duality movement/inertia, which takes a circular, zodiacal path under the “gravitational” pull exerted by the center point.  Upon completion of its circuit, aeons have passed and the first ring is complete, giving rise to 3, Binah, Saturnine conditions, the emergence of time and 2 dimensional consciousness.  Then a new condition, 4, Chesed, emerges, an orthogonal projection of movement, giving rise to the possibility of a 3rd dimension, structure, the full flower of Jupiter.  Finally, 5, the sphere having been traced, Geburah imposes its limits, the Ring-Pass-Not.

I was taking a first pass at the final paragraph of the assigned text and really beating my head against a wall- some of the sentences just didn’t even make grammatical sense!- so I decided to check out whether the Milennial Edition might be part of the issue.  I downloaded a PDF of the “other” version from the sixcrows.org link posted above by CRPatiño, and guess what? MUCH better. Grammar problems solved. Also, the sentence which ends the paragraph in the Millennial Edition has much more to it in the other edition, including a description of the Ring-Pass-Not as the Prime Limitation, and the other edition has this additional sentence not included in the Millenial: “Therefore, at base, it is the Prime Evil which enables the Cosmos to come into being.” Those seem like some juicy bits to be missing. So heads-up, folks who are making do with the Millenial Edition in paper, it might be worth comparing versions electronically now and again.

In your reply to Yanocoches, you said, “…it’s useful to get a clear sense of the Ring-Pass-Not as the sphere traced by the outer edge of the Ring-Cosmos as it pivots around its intersections with the Ring-Chaos.”
The image I get, then, has the Ring-Cosmos inside the spherical Ring-Pass-Not, and the Ring-Chaos outside the RPN Sphere.  Is that correct?  Also the rings connect at two points.   Does the line between the two points form an axis around which the Ring Chaos and the Ring-Cosmos tumble?  It seems possible that the rings could also generate a Ring-Pass-Not if the ‘axis’ tumbled end over end, or in other orientations.
I am tempted to try my own drawings of these images–Would it be better to only visualize them?
Thank you, once again, for a fascinating commentary on this difficult book!  Perhaps, at the end of this series, you will publish an annotated Cosmic Doctrine?

Hello, I am awfully glad this post will stay up for the month.  I’m still chewing on the first paragraph on the unmanifest.  Pure existence which IS, and is substance, stable, ‘reality’ (why the quotes here, I wonder), source of all. It is not appearances, or becoming, it is without qualities, or history. It is unknowable. It is unity, manifestation begins when duality occurs.  This prompts a reflection on the manifest, which is not substance or stable, which springs from a source, is not ‘reality’ (why the quotes?), is appearances, becoming, has qualities, has history, is knowable – all of which, I would add, are precious features of life as we know it. 
Presumably manifestation also ends when unity occurs. 
This would be why the unmanifest is also “the Great Negation”, because at any point, if unity occurs from duality, all manifestation is dissolved. Union negates manifestation, its qualities and its history.  And perhaps it is this which makes certain types of potential union (such as a sexual union between two incarnate beings, or a mystical union with non-incarnate beings) feel fraught with danger.

Vilya, mightiest of the Three, blue and gold, as if it might be Sky and Sun, Strand and Sea, shall stand for the Ring Cosmos.  Rivendell, the Homeliest Home, has (according to Samwise) something of everything: the Shire and the Golden Wood, Gondor, king’s houses, inns, meadows and mountains all mixed. The Third Ring, Narya, wth the stone red as fire, fits best as the Ring Pass-Not; as indeed, Gandalf, wielding it, says to the Balrog “You shall not pass!” He prevents evil from crossing the abyss, and also from breaching the bounds of Good Taste, or at least of Decent Propriety. Very British, that. 
That leaves Nenya, of mithril and frosty white adamant to play the role of Ring-Chaos. Lothlorien, situated outside the Cosmos, place of ageless time where days bring healing and not decay, demonstrating the negative evil of slowing Change by drag and resistance against mortal mechnicals and their whirligigs of motion. The Place where trees are Home. How the trees get their roots nourished if decay is retarded, I do not know; maybe decay is whisked out of sight by Elf CharLadies?
To be sure, Galadriel is associated with the changeless stars and when tempted by the One Ring imagines being more treacherous than the sea, stronger than the foundations of the earth, which argues that her sympathies are with elemental forces that tend to oppose and resist the pesky incursions of Man and his straight-line Machines into places of beauty and natural curves (ooh-la-la!) 
I should have thought the One Ring was more chaotically evil, but perhaps that ring is a ‘positive’ evil or a corrupting one, like, say, the tripartite Rings of money, greed, and pride, domination, decadence, and despair. Pure, hurtless Gold being the form of the One Ring, and treeless, dead landscapes of desolation being the end result of its action –what else to set against it save the Red, White and Blue colors of the British Flag?
Where is the Ring polished Oak  and Emerald Green? is my question. Does Radamast the Brown wear it? Or Goldberry, River Daughter? Where, if it exists, shall we find it? And who shall wield it? Elessar’s Beryl is all but overthrown, once more. Gr8 Jet Coal and the Gyre of Plastic rule the land and the sea. Perhaps the Emerald was shattered and its fragments lie scattered about the world, powerless – – unless a thousand of thousands of thousands of little Samwise Gardeners dig it up from the soil and, all together, put it to use…?

Dirtyboots, good. You can also see the three rings as the three supernals, and the seven planes (which we’ll get to in a few chapters) as the seven spheres below the Abyss. There are other ways of relating the systems, too. Which is correct? Whichever one helps you make sense of the metaphors. 
Heather, yep — that’s why I prefer the revised edition, and why I’m talking with a publisher right now about getting it back in print. 
E. Goldstein, yes, the Ring-Cosmos is inside the Ring-Pass-Not and the Ring-Chaos is outside it. The axis that connects them is the axis on which the Ring-Cosmos pivots, but the Ring-Chaos remains stationary in the metaphor — since there’s nothing outside the Ring-Chaos but the Unmanifest, of course, there’s no way to tell whether the Ring-Chaos moves or not, since there’s nothing manifest against which you can gauge its movement. 
Thank you, by the way, and I’ve already lined up a publisher for a commentary on the Cos. Doc. — it’ll probably be twice as large as the Cos. Doc. itself! 
Scotlyn, excellent. Yes, and again yes. 
GKB, hah! I knew somebody was going to take me up on the implied challenge. The question of the green ring is an interesting one — the rhyme only provides for three elven-rings, but there would seem to be a fourth wanted…

Galadriel also threw down the walls of Dol Guldur and “cleansed’ its evil, so she must be a Superb Housekeeper to put that slimy mess in good order. Who could destroy positive evil better than negative Evil who lives in the Forest Primeval? Tolkien also said that Death was a Gift to Man so that Aragorn and Arwen may meet again “beyond the circles of the World.”  Speaking of circles, the last paragraph says, “On the outer sphere there is also a secondary derivation, and… it represents…the prime stillness…that which resists, which alone enables MOMENTUM to be achieved, and you may call it the Ring-Chaos—the “Prime Evil.” (all-caps, mine) Not motion, not movement but *momentum*, or possibly, acceleration?
Some kind of perpetual motion machine seems posited. Or else the Positive Cosmos forces are stronger than the negative Cosmos forces. Because, otherwise, if Upper-Outflow positive Cosmic arc is attracted to Negative left-hand top-half Chaos arc, what happens once it swings just past the nearest surface of Chaosring? Why, the backside of that Chaos-arc is positive, which ought (in good physics) to be attractive to the negative Underside Cosmos-outflow arc, hence make the Cosmos start swinging backwards! So that the drag (if equal) would tend to make the Cosmic Platter stand still, not keep on turning.
Unless both Ring-spins are so perfectly timed as to make each Positive-Negative Draw be followed directly by a Neg-Neg or Pos-Pos Push. Or if Pos-Cos  force is stronger than Neg-Cos force, so positive-motivated movement always wins.  Or there is a wildly unpredictable mix of meetings between pos’es and neg’s of each Ring so that the Cosmos would wobble all over the place if it were not secured by pins at the two points where Chaos touches down. Which means you never know which way the World is gonna Turn: flipping forward, s-l-o-w-l-y turning backwards, speeding up then halting with a jerk—etc.
Okay, I know, I know, this is only metaphor. But at what point does the metaphor break down and become inapplicable?
Come fo(u)rth Rings for Hobbit Things:
barley, milk, and song.
Each tiny chip of emerald
makes us severally strong.
Barley, hulled; Milk, butter, cream;
By songs sweet lulled as in a dream.
Though we are scattered, weak and small,
attend to matters house and Hall.
Every tree, and thee and me
Mayor and Thain and All.
Stand firm and rooted fine:
Taters, beets and long-leaf pine,
Maple, cherry, plum, and ash,
Beech and yew and oak;
Corn and orchard, clover, grass,
Longbottom leaf for smoke.
Rings on our fingers; hair on our toes
In our hands, the Middle Lands:
Who knows, who stays, who goes?

JMG wrote, “Can you imagine anything as being outside of infinite space?”  I used to try to do that when I was a child.  But like Wordsworth wrote, ” At length the Man perceives it die away,/And fade into the light of common day.”  When I told my parents what I was thinking about, they told me not to; it’d make me crazy,   I just returned from a week with no computers, TV, cellphones, coffee or alcohol, and am reading this week’s post for the first time today – so I’ll be rereading more carefully the chapter in question over the next month.

Much of the first page (first four paragraphs) of the Cosmic Doctrine is reminiscent to me of the Buddhist teachings on emptiness and dependent origination which imply that to be manifest something else has to arise alongside it. Nothing is able to exist without something else, “this” implies “that.” Therefore all phenomena are “empty” because nothing exists in isolation, without duality. And perhaps that is why the word “Reality” as applied to the Unmanifest is in quotation marks, because it is actually what we would think of as not-Reality from the point of view of manifestation.
I have spent much of the day pondering the idea of the prime duality being ‘space’ and ‘movement.’ And I keep asking myself whether space would be able to exist without movement. The reverse was easier to see. As I know it from years of studying movement via dance and physical therapy, movement does not exist without space. Movement simply cannot occur without space in which to manifest itself. Even the joints of our bodies have to have a measure of space in order to move. Once that space collapses, range of motion diminishes and eventually ceases to exist, a “frozen joint.” As I think about the inverse, space existing without movement, it occurs to me that movement defines space. As we walk around a room, we define the space of the room. A dance composition defines the space in which it takes place, and the space is an integral part of the dance. The clouds and the rain bands that I can see outside my window as I type this define the space of the sky for me today. So perhaps space is as dependent on movement as movement is dependent on space.
The other theme for my thoughts today has been the ideas as DF defines them of momentum vs. inertia, momentum being the force causing movement and inertia being the force causing non-movement. I wonder if these two forces also serve as a type of prime duality. Both have the quality of ‘inertia’ as defined in physics of things continuing as they are, bodies at rest tending to stay at rest and bodies in motion tending to stay in motion. And DF states that each factor is present in all motion. Each force, momentum and inertia, acting together, acting on each other, creates change, otherwise no change would occur. Things would continue as they are. This led me to Fortune’s definition of magic as a *change* in consciousness in accordance with will. 
So magic could be thought of as the ability through the exertion of will to utilize the forces of momentum and inertia to effect a change. For example, one could apply the force of inertia or momentum (or both at different times) on a habitual pattern of behavior, depending on which is needed when to create the desired change, or one could apply one force to overcome or nudge the other to create the desired change.
Thanks so much for this,
Yanocoches

@Jen
Concerning your first comment, having just switched to the Revised Edition I find that the Sun is ungendered in that edition’s wording; but in response to your observation that “the female pole is not mentioned” I was looking at the section and my mind latched on to some of the old folklore about Lilith and Eve as significant; make of this tentative line of thought what you will. 
Thinking of thermodynamics, the churning of energy behind life requires the heat sink of the dark night every bit as much as the heat source of the radiant Sun. Lilith is symbolic of the female as that heat sink, as demon of the night, and mother of demons by union with the Angle of Death; she is deeply related to the Ring-Chaos. Also she is co-created with the prime masculine of Adam in the folk lore. Furthermore, in many a tradition the Primal Waters is associated with femininity, but being undifferentiated it itself lacks gender, but the Ring-Chaos represents the Primal Waters to the Ring-Cosmos; so for the Ring-Chaos to be symbolized as a female pole to the Logos makes some degree of sense. The Darkness itself as the feminine to the Rays of the Logos, fits to a certain degree of truth, but I don’t reckon it captures enough, it needs Eve.
The Earth, planets in general, is made of the remains of stars; parallel to Eve’s origin story; and unlike Lilith who only gave birth to demons, the Earth is stupendously fertile of generative life. Also Eve is the trigger of knowledge; similar to how the material basis of the Earth as a recipient of the emanations of the Logos is capable of memory and history, while the cold cold night of Lilith can only take the emanations back into the perfect stillness beyond.
This parallel jacks up the carefully laid out chain of being of the tradition from which I borrowed the figures, specifically by conflating Adam with the Logos, but so it goes. Dion may have a totally different direction in mind, but I thought this line of thinking seemed significant to me.

@JMG  some further thoughts and @Yanocoches whose thoughts are the ones that cohere with further thoughts… 
“Nothing is able to exist without something else, “this” implies “that.””  
It had struck me forcefully that the list of things the CD says the unmanifest is “without” – being “qualities” and “history” – seems to be missing the thing that so many human creation stories mention – ie “relationship”.  Unity is without relationship.  The manifest begins when duality occurs and relationship becomes possible.  
To me, the possibility of relationship, wherein qualities and history will matter, is what makes manifestation of finite beings precious, and perhaps, dare I say it, necessary. Though, of course, what do I know? Perhaps, I should say, “necessary to manifest beings”. 
Also: “Movement simply cannot occur without space in which to manifest itself.”  Again, it strikes me that movement also cannot occur without time in which to manifest itself.  In this chapter of the CD, time is not referred to directly, but is implied in the use of the word “history”.  Still, for movement to occur there must be a time before, a time after, and a time during which it is occurring.  And the movement creates a history of the where and the when it has been.
And, Yanocoches, whose name suggests a meaning in Spanish of “already no cars”, thank you for placing change into the context of magic and “change of consciousness”.  More to think about. 🙂

I was musing on the title of this chapter,“The Dawn of Manifestation”. To experience dawn, one must be on a planet with the sun coming up behind the horizon. The image Dion Fortune gives us of the three rings has the reader’s perspective on the outside of the cosmos, which would be like looking at the sun and planets from outer space, where dawns are not experienced. So I took it to be a clue to understanding the metaphor from the inside, from the manifested point of view because just like you cannot experience a dawn unless you are on a planet, you cannot experience the dawn of manifestation unless you are already manifested, which is not possible.
Pure existence, the unmanifest, is not yet hidden behind a horizon to dawn. What is there that could create the horizon to hide the unmanifest from the eyes of those in the shadows before the dawn? There are no eyes as yet to see and nothing as yet to be the horizon.
So I imagined the unmanifest as black space, and in that unmanifest, the desire to move was matched by the desire for inertia and, balanced, movement was held back. Stillness, even though both inertia and momentum are desires of the same space. Just like before a dawn, though, when there is a glow building on the horizon as the sun approaches, the desire for movement grew stronger until, like the sun’s rays that spill over the horizon, which is inertia in this case, it overcomes the horizon and floods the land with its rays. 
The dawn of manifestation occurred at the point when the desire for movement overcame the desire for inertia because the first movement through space is already manifestation. Movement and space is the prime duality, and manifestation begins when duality occurs.
The Logos/Sun then is the unmanifest-that-becomes-manifest as it clears the horizon of inertia, and it traces an arc in the sky, much like the ring cosmos, from our point of view. 
I’m connecting inertia with the resistance that Will encountered that produced consciousness.  Was that also inertia or something else? I’m also connecting dawn to the East/Air/Illumination of the SOP. And that one must overcome inertia to manifest anything. And, back to my image above of dawn, a horizon becomes possible only when one force becomes greater than the other that held it in balance, and the illumination of dawn can be experienced. Somewhere in all of this, is the fact that the unmanifest is hidden from us, behind a horizon (of manifestation?) This spins off into a lot of possible meditations. Hmmm.

I’m not sure if I’m visualizing this the way some others are.
We have a prime movement in space which attracts more space to it, thus setting up a spinning disk like a ring of Saturn. However, the thing I note here is that the “disk” has a very large center, so it is really more like a ring of Saturn (as DF says) than a vinyl record or a clock face, unless one imagines the center holes in each of those as being very, very large. Another way to visualize this, perhaps, is as a very large, very slowly rotating, stationary hurricane, made up purely of motion in space, with a very large eye.
A second ring is set up in opposition to this, also like a ring of Saturn, at right angles to the first and just outside it, which makes it larger in diameter than the first.
The inner, spinning ring begins a second movement, one of rotation around an imaginary axis.
Of this second movement, as I understand the text, DF then says (Millennium edition): “The secondary spin of the first circuit is the Ring-Pass-Not, and the circuit of the second formation [which I take to mean that motion which is described by the second, rotational spin of the ring about an imaginary axis] is that sphere which sets a bound to Chaos.” Essentially, then, the first ring, by its secondary motion around an imaginary axis, becomes a kind of Dyson sphere. This is not the solid kind, which isn’t what Freeman Dyson had originally intended, and which is the least probable kind, and not, obviously, constructed for the purpose Dyson intended; the Wikipedia article on the Dyson sphere shows some alternatives. DF’s is another, if we accept this analogy as useful (and not strictly speaking correct, since she is not envisioning capturing as much energy as possible from a star). It is this hollow, virtual sphere which is the Ring-Pass-Not. (It is virtual because it is constructed by a secondary, rotational motion. It is not solid.) The Ring-Cosmos then consists of its original motion and the Ring-Pass-Not (the kind of Dyson sphere set up by the secondary, rotational movement of the first disk/ring around an imaginary axis). “When this secondary movement has completed its first circuit and sets up its steady revolution, the new Cosmos is in being.” So the new Cosmos is the product of both movements of the Ring-Cosmos; it comes into being once the first round of secondary movement has been completed.
I’m a bit unclear whether the Ring-Chaos bounds this Cosmos or is included as part of it. I’m inclined to think the former, since it is the “thrust-block” that prompts the Cosmos into being, “the prime stillness, — the immobility in which it is rooted.” This would make sense, since Cosmos and Chaos are in a sense opposed.

This reminds me of nothing so much as the little electric motors we built in Cub Scouts: the ring of wire inside the ring of magnet, with a commutator and battery to keep it all going. If I continue this metaphor, that means that the “current” through the Ring-Cosmos needs to reverse periodically to keep the Ring Pass-Not in existence. There’s also the implication that there’s…something…out in the Unmanifest that provides enough energy to keep the Ring-Cosmos turning.
And if we’re aboard the Ring-Cosmos, if we could see past the Ring Pass-Not we would see the Ring-Chaos and the Unmanifest itself whirling madly…but that’s a meditation for another day.

								June 18, 2018 at 6:44 pm							




I don’t see how the ring chaos could be stationary. Isn’t it so that nothing is stationary?
The ring chaos got set up as a reaction to the ring cosmos, and it formed itself by moving. And what, it met up with its other end and stopped moving?







 onething says: 



								June 18, 2018 at 7:07 pm							




I can see, but only in a limited way, why it makes any sense to consider the ring chaos as the prime evil. Yes, that which truly blocks development could be evil, but likewise that which remains stuck and hard also could be called evil. So the chaos resists differentiation and tends toward God or the unmanifest. But the excessively manifest (human ego?) resists God and surrender and ultimately resists change, learning and growth, if too strong.
It’s interesting the DF says that evil left to its own devices tends toward dissolution and will be too simplified to remain evil and thus can be transformed into good.
It is obvious that it would be a true evil if either force did not exist.
We all know about entropy, and consider it generally as a bad thing. My car is going through some serious entropy right now, and I’m not happy about it! But who has realized that entropy is a gift almost equal to existence itself? If we had no entropy, the whole universe would have frozen up long ago. It is the dissolution of things back into their constituent parts that allows this great kaleidoscope to keep turning.
I thought of an analogy when I read Kafka’s Metamorphosis (what was I doing reading fiction? : )
The son in the family did not just become any insect, he became a dung beetle. I think in terms of worms, because we keep worms and therefore have a vermicompost system. These worms and dung beetles eat disgusting stuff – but their excrement is lovely, sweet smelling loam. Whereas we like fresh food but our excrement is arguably rather foul and we are even ashamed of it. The point is that without the vultures and worms and awful bacteria, we couldn’t get a fresh clean start.
The cosmos is no different. If all remained unmanifested in a timeless forever, that would be dreary! But without the return to the unmanifest everything would ultimately turn to crap unredeemably and we would no doubt become completely insane.

Greetings JMG and all,
CR Patino, thanks for the link to the revised edition!
In considering the effects of dinergy/complementary but unequal forces producing a curved movement, I can’t help but think of the formation of meanders in rivers, their curving and recurving over time. (Thanks to the Sandy River and Its oxbows where I was spending time last week for that insight.)
Apologies if what I’m trying to say isn’t very clear or sensible- I’m still chewing on it 🙂
I started thinking of this process in terms of what I had read here and in the CosDoc because I had a hunch that the two might be related.
This seemed at first to contrast with conceiving of the circle, disc and sphere (or -slightly-  ellipsoid forms of those?) of the CosDoc’s genesis, which in my mind appears more symmetrical and closed. To me, a symmetrical, closed system is also soon a dead system. So how can all -this- come from -that-? There had to be a wobble in there somewhere. And that’s where the unequal but complementary forces come into play, in the beginning, the desires of space for movement and for inertia.
However, might the boundaries of this regular, closed, macro-system of Ring Cosmos, Ring Chaos, And Ring-Pass-Not that emerged from the two desires, by the fact that the boundaries exist, cause the alternation of the forces inside to occur on a wide variety of smaller scales, and give the appearance from inside of being a bit more irregular? The ratio of the scales of the curves when viewed together fitted inside one another are asymmetrical, but each component curve of that system may well be symmetrical in and of itself.  
The symmetricality is one moment in time/POV, the nesting systems giving the appearance of asymmetricality is another.
That idea makes me think of the wheel of the year, and the transformations that occur in its arcing. It’s the alternation of unequal but complementary forces that drives the transformations, in both polarities, and in multi-participant actions. Not just alternations of forces of equal power, but of those powers in their waxing and waning at various points in their movement and metamorphoses. The year’s turning can be conceived of as perfectly symmetrical and balanced circle/sphere in one macro-view, and as a relationship-field of forces and movements that are never at any one time equal and symmetrical, but always moving and acting on one another which in turn changes and shapes those forces and relationships.
I don’t know that that is entrely correct, but it feels like it’s edging up to a picture of how it might be. I need to meditate on it more.
Thanks!
Bonnie

It just makes so much sense to me that in the unchanging, limitless Unmanifest there was something that wanted to move- of course it desired to move- but it also did not want to unmake the perfect eternal stillness. Who has not felt the pull to leave and the pull to stay? And finally the desire for change overcame the desire for sameness, and then imagine that first rush of movement! The very first differentiation, duality, separateness! But of course the pull towards origin doesn’t go away just because movement is wonderful; it always shapes the course of the movement, and eventually One comes home, back to where it all began, but now the differentness continues, since the movement outwards Itself created something new, which doesn’t disappear just because the circle has come around. And so the perfect arc of movement continues, outward and back, ever returning, singing its manifestness in the cold dark Unmanifest, whirling its own Being.
But one day, one aeon, there is a niggling sideways pull at the edge of the path, and another exactly halfway back to home… 
That is as far as I have gotten today. I am not generally given to poetry, or even very imaginative prose. This seemed to introduce itself to my brain on its own. I am hoping the Ring-Chaos drops in to say hi, too, since I am very curious about what that feels like.
Enjoying everyone’s thoughtful comments, especially gkb’s Hobbit song. I laughed out loud at “Rings on our fingers; hair on our toes…”

I wanted to echo the resemblance between the Emptiness and the zero point field where pairs of virtual particles are continually popping in and out of existence. Some cosmologist wonder if our universe simply arose from random fluctuations of the zero point field. Thermodynamics allows for local decreases in entropy of the system even by random fluctuations as long as net entropy increases.
I noticed that the initial forces momentum and inertia are apposed by not completely, that is they are not anti-parallel. In order for inertia to pull momentum in to an arc there must be a component that is orthogonal.

I came across these questions while I was reading:
In response to “IT is the verb “ to be” turned back on its self. “  Does that literally mean “ IT IS is TO BE”?
Also: “IT is a state of pure “being”, without qualities and without history.”  Does this mean with out consciousness and without a memory?
Also:  “The Unmanifest is the Great Negation; at the same time IT is the finite potency which has not occurred.”  Would this be similar to a description of Cerwidin’s Cauldron?
Also:  “All I can say is “space” was moving: you will find these words a clue to much.”  Is this idea similar to the discussion of Schopenhauer’s “Will”?
Also:  If I imagine cosmos disk spinning fast enough it creates the optical illusion of a solid sphere, so the image that came to mind was the earth rotating on its axis with the atmosphere being the Ring-Pass-Not and space being the Ring Chaos, does this fit of is it too literal?
Also: I don’t understand the moral judgement of “Prime Evil”.  Is it just a matter of perspective?  From a seal’s point of view a shark is evil, but from the shark’s point of view it’s just hungry.  It is limited in it’s diet.  Shark’s (or at least most species of sharks) don’t have the option of being vegetarian.  Evil to me implies a desire to cause harm, is having a limit the same as being evil?
Thanks for offering the book club, it’s fun to think about these things with other people.
Sincerely,
Candace

On the Ring-Chaos being stationary.. I, too, had thought of it moving as well the Ring-Cosmos, seeing them spinning in opposite directions, one inside the other. But from where could that be “seen”? – only from outside, outside manifestation, which makes no sense. If we are in the cosmos, we either see ourselves at stationary, or everything else. It would be more common, wouldn’t it, to posit ‘ourselves’ as the stationary part?

Gkb, how far until the metaphor breaks down? A good question with no firm answer. Keep on applying it in different ways, and see what kind of sense it makes as a metaphor for other things.
Phutatorius, one of the advantages of childhood is that you try things like that. 😉
Yanocoches, here as so often this week, I’m just sitting back and watching the meditations unfold.
Scotlyn, true enough — in unity there can be no relationship. The first and simplest relationship is that of the first two rings; can you apply that metaphor to other forms of relationship? 
Myriam, nicely done. 
Squalembrato, no, you’re basically on target. The Ring-Chaos bounds the system; it’s on the outside of the Ring-Pass-Not and thus represents the Unmanifest for all beings who are part of the Ring-Cosmos. 
RPC, good! A metaphor for a metaphor… 
Onething, “stationary” in that it spins in place, rather than tumbling end over end the way the Ring-Cosmos does. As for the Ring-Chaos as the Prime Evil, we’ll be developing that in much more detail in next month’s reading. 
Bonnie, excellent! We’ll be getting to the genesis of smaller cycles within the great Rings in upcoming chapters. 
Heather, very nicely done.
Andrew, exactly. Nothing in the cosmos of the Cos. Doc. is exactly opposed to anything else. More on this as we proceed…
Candace, those are excellent questions, and i’d encourage you to spend this month reflecting on them, and any more that come to mind. One hint: the desire to cause harm is only one kind of evil, and a very complex mode of what Fortune calls positive evil. What we’re discussing here is negative evil — if you will, the evil of Murphy’s Law and of the endlessly frustrating stuckness of existence. More on this next month!
Matt, ding! Got it in one. “Stationary,” as Einstein pointed out, is always a matter of whose perspective we’re discussing…

I see that nobody so far has brought up Newton’s spinning bucket argument or what Einstein called “Mach’s Principle.”  The rather confusing description at the bottom of p.12 referring to “the outer sphere” which also has “a secondary derivation….” is what I have in mind.  Mach’s Principle is an attempt to deal with absolute and relative motion and fixed reference frames as illustrated in the spinning bucket argument.  Here the idea of a “thrust block” makes good sense in terms of the notion of a fixed background or reference frame against which motion can be measured.   But the description on p.12 is confusing because it refers to an outer sphere; I had pictured only one sphere, that of the “ring pass not.”   Does this imply that there are two spheres?

Bonnie’s and Heather’s comments read one after the other somehow coalesced in my mind as the action of Wolfram’s Rules of change and alternation: how different rules of simple changes create different patterns, sometimes regular, sometimes chaotic and/or fractal, sometimes all three emerging from the same rule, but proceeding down the left, middle, or right side of the page as the rule continues to operate.

I went back to the first ring and thought about it some more. Got the picture of vague, drifting disturbance above and below the spinning ring—sort of like two kaiser roll bun tops with the Cosmos sandwiched between like a slice of very thin ham, creating a vast sphere of three-part differentiation. The two kaiser bun tops spun in opposite directions (deosil and widdershins) and gradually ground away at the cosmos until they fragmented it and drew it back into a disorganized state. So paired, they effectively neutralized its motion, returning everything to undifferentiated unity. Then I thought there is no evidence against the idea that some such thing might have happened before or be happening now for all I know.  And the same for many other possible angles of ‘lift’ or ‘drag.’ It is only in the specific case where the rings of motion occur at right angles, and are ‘pinned’ by polarity, so to speak, that the secondary spheres of motion emerge from the system.  
The Cub Scout motor might be the same—only at a specific, fixed angle does the working current emerge from the relationship between the magnet and the coil of copper wire. So it is only under the condition that unequal oppositions are fixed at right angles to one another that the ‘motor’ of increasing complexity is set going. After that, it does not matter if the sphere of Chaos is careering round everywhichaway like a greased ball-bearing in its socket of the Unmanifest—it will always be locked into cross-hatched opposition to the cosmic sphere and appear static from within the cosmos. Which agrees more with my untaught notion of how Chaos dances, so I like it better. Of course, if the ‘pin’ of polarity should work loose, that’s when some serious odd would come into play.

I read chapter 1 last year. I’d intended to read the whole book, but I couldn’t make heads or tails of the Ring-Chaos. After that, my brain just sort of sat there tapping its foot until I was done looking at words. So I set the Cos. Doc. aside to await this discussion.
Here’s the interesting part. I reread the chapter before I read this post, and I was able to visualize everything. What changed? Maybe it was a cumulative effect of several more months of daily ritual work. Maybe some part of my unconscious mind had been chewing it over. But I like to think it was my exposure to the Sphere of Protection.
There’s a version of the ritual on the AODA website, but the portion called Circulating the Light is described incorrectly. In the Magic Monday Q&A of March 26, Mr. Greer gives the correct description, which I copied word for word into my journal. It’s not a ritual I currently use, but it’s likely that I will at some point. Besides, being able to visualize it right scratched an old itch.
The imaginal construct of the Sphere of Protection is not what is found in chapter 1 of The Cosmic Doctrine, but I think it gave me what I needed to make the leap.

Dirtyboots,
that sounds interesting.  I seemed to perceive the infinity symbol as a result of trying to visualize the movement of the three rings simultaneously.   For me it was more of a feeling that I noticed in my body.  Like you, I have no idea what, if anything, it could mean at this point!  Thanks for sharing your other insights on the Tree of Life, too.

I have been up in the mountains to which I must soon return, and am hideously behind on comments and correspondence, but a couple things I have been thinking about before I lose communicative ability again:
JMG, thank you for clarifying that the rings are indeed very basic forms of manifestation. It seems to me that the description Fortune gives of the Ring-Chaos toward the end of the chapter makes it sound as if the Ring-Chaos is itself the Unmanifest, or a representation thereof, at least to whatever exists inside the Ring-Pass-Not. The sense I’m getting is that the Ring-Chaos is as close as we within the Cosmos can get to contemplating the actual Unmanifest, which is still further out.
I was also thinking about the fact that the Ring-Cosmos exists for a while without the Ring-Chaos; good without evil (even laying aside the moral baggage of these words, by which I gather Fortune means something closer to creativity/order and entropy). I swear I am not deliberately trying to squeeze this text into a Judeo-Christian box, but this inevitably brought to mind Paradise before the Fall and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Perhaps it’s because I’m revisiting Milton. Indeed, Adam and Eve did not seem to do much of anything before the Fall, so perhaps the idea of Prime Evil as thrust block works here too!
Speaking of Milton, as I was reading Paradise Lost and seething with dislike for his egomaniacal prig of a God, it occurred to me that if we are thinking of the Unmanifest as God, perhaps the most significant difference from the Judeo-Christian narrative is that Fortune’s is a Pantheistic vision; God does not create the universe but becomes it. And the Judeo-Christian God (particularly God the Father) also strikes me as being a rather unbalanced half of a polarity (male/female and solar/telluric, among others) rather than a Unity.

I’ve read and worked on the images as given in the text a few times, returning each time to the beginning to look deeper or afresh or … something… (using both versions, one in print, useful for marginalia and question marks, and one electronic, useful for finding easier original wording).
Today I would like to ask two questions, the first about the way something is worded and to find a way to un-stick my conceptions from what the text suggests, and the second about what position might be useful to take relative to the text and adherence to image and metaphor.
1. Here is the text: “The Unmanifest is… best conceived of under the image of inter-stellar space.” What this suggests to me is the space between bodies. I find this a counterintuitive understanding of something called Unmanifest that’s equated with ‘pure existence,’ ‘the source from which all arises,’ ‘infinite potentiality.’ Why not liken it to infinite space, or primordial vacuous space or some other term, I wonder. Inter-stellar, by its definition, calls to (my) mind that which is manifest already. How can pure potentiality, the *a priori* of beingness exist or be imagined existing, in interstices between already manifest things (stars, planetary bodies, atoms/molecules, etc., without concession to that limitation. Am I making an assumption that the text is referring to that which exists, to existence itself as the origin of all things?  
2. This leads to something perhaps more fundamental to my approach of this exercise: I am of two minds – to engage the images at face value – to work with them and let them work with me as they are given – and thus to take them as close to literally as possible (as much as is possible for a human mind, or for *this* human mind, versus or in conjunction with taking the text as metaphor (as is suggested, and thereby to not get too concerned about the wording). Do I take DF’s approximations and go with the “gist” of what she means? Should i continue to do both? Is one to be preferred?
My boat’s a bit beached on these shores… so thank you for any suggestions.

I can’t shake the sense that the Ring Chaos serves as a prime meridian, establishing in its intersection with the Ring Cosmos the primordial celestial poles and serving as a primitive horizon from which to begin to mark time’s passing–the first and successive dawns.  In this way it serves a corrective role, a navigational standard of time and position–the earliest sense of objectivity from which justice has a chance to arise.  Though the Ring Chaos does not belong to the cosmos, it is an essential girder of the cosmos, helping to keep further developments within the cosmoplasm from running off the rails.

JMG,
It seems you have created a run on the market for revised editions of the book – AbeBooks cheapest copy stands at $64.29 as of writing this comment, and the copy I ordered got cancelled.
Everyone,
In an effort to expand my search to find a reasonably priced copy, I have created a spreadssheet (which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I62UFXhrvjExV588lST3d9CWSuQlscdodYVW0m983aM/edit?usp=sharing) of the editions of the book so I can search by ISBN, but I do not know exactly which are the revised edition. 
Is anyone willing to add to the spreadsheet to note whether their edition is revised or original? If there are editions I have missed, I would value that addition as well.
Hopefully this can be a resource for everyone searching for a copy of the book.
DutyBound

Hi JMG,
“To be” is to act, to create yourself in movement, to become.  But the Unmanifest is without becoming.
Does this relate to your essay on Sartre?  The inertia of untaken paths hangs over each of us and drags our ambitions towards innaction?
Thanks,
Johnny

Greetings All,
I’m a newcomer to the site. I stumbled across it while studying Eastern philosophy and found an essay by JMG about the Tao Te Ching being an introductory textbook of systems thinking. I’m excited to read more of this book and see where it goes. My first three thoughts are
1) this seems like a westernized rehash of a lot of Buddhism and Taoism. Why not go straight to the source? I ask earnestly. Is it different? Is it the same but westernized to make it more accessible to different cultures? Or was it a marketing technique to cash in? I enjoy zen koans so I wrote this – I finally met a guru who told me the truth. He told me that all gurus are liars.
2) Has any read Jeremy England’s theory of why life exists? He is an MIT math guy who claims to have a formula that proves that life forms from energy essentially to dissipate energy. The more complex the life form, the more efficient it is at dissipation. I’m no mathematician but to me it helps with a lot of this philosophy. If the unmanifest, or Tao or Brahman is the pure energy of everything, then it would make sense that energy must dissipate, thus the need for manifestation and life.
3) Dion mentions movement being the first manifestation. Wouldn’t the first manifestation be time? Are movement and time two words/concepts for the same thing?
I look forward to seeing exploring and discussing.
-Doc
Ps – I practice yoga and mantra meditation twice daily. Are there any things I need to be aware of or more informed about on this journey with you all. I know very little of the western occult.

Thank you so much for this assignment JMG – I was looking for something to do for the next 3 years 🙂
I am slow to absorb new things, but quick to jump to wobbly conclusions, so the slow reading method makes sense for me for sure.  I’ve allowed the Ring metaphors to steep for a couple of weeks (I admit to starting before your post last week), and this morning I ventured into the discussion of ‘good’ and ‘evil’.  I’ve been reading a few sentences before my morning meditation, then sitting with them and seeing what comes up.  My understanding of DF’s core point on not resisting evil, which is really her Master’s point, is to let it be and so to let it go.  The Ring Cosmos, if we want to call it ‘good’, is creative, concentrating.  The Ring Chaos, in opposition to that, tends to dissolution.  So to oppose ‘evil’ in this context is simply to allow it to disperse, rather than throwing a lot of positive energy at it in resistance to it?  I’ve found that with my own emotional and other troubles over the years – that holding on to them, through carrying grudges, holding grievances or generally obsessing about them – builds them up.   To just be with them allows them to disperse and move on.  Transmutation back to nothingness.  This is just a glimpse of an idea at this point, but am I on the right lines?

Archdruid,
The first manifestation is movement, it created a dualism from the unmanifest. I was really confused by this because the book says the desire for movement was opposed by the desire for intertia. It seems like two things sprung from the potential of the unmanifest, but that’s not quite right. The unmanifest is potential, and desire is also just potential. When the potential/desire turns to movement, it becomes will and is countered by will. A negative against a negative, or positive against a positive. That is to say desire/potential/unmanifest became will/movement/manifestation. The potential was realized in a common force of movement and resistance. Movement cannot happen without resistance. 
You need both resistance and movement to have manifestation. 
So much more to sort through. 
I am enjoying the pure symbolism of this book. It occurs to me that symbolic exploration is one of the schools of philosophy that scientific materialism has most viciously attacked and destroyed, because it is the one school that can expose SM as the symbolic model that it is. 
Regards,
Varun

I’ve been following along with everyone’s comments via subscription and I love the conversation going on so far.
On a Cosmic Doctrine semi-related note, John, I wanted to ask if it would be a bad idea to be reading Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine at the same time. I’ve had the massive tome for a while and it’s finally seemed like a time to start chipping away at it, but since we are working with the CD meditatively, would tossing in the SD as personal reading potentially confuse things?

Phutatorius, I’ll have to look up Newton’s spinning bucket — my background in physics isn’t that extensive. As for the reference to the “outer sphere,” that’s confusingly phrased; I took it to mean the outside as distinct from the inside of the Ring-Pass-Not. 
Patricia, glad to hear it! I hope your arm is healing well. 
Gkb, I need to go back to Wolfram again and see how much intersection I can find between his ideas and the Cos. Doc. — my guess is that there’ll be quite a bit. As for cosmic kaiser rolls, sure, but here again those aren’t the specific images Fortune is using to try to communicate with, you know…
Ynnothir, fascinating. It might be entertaining sometime to work with the relation of the SoP to the Cos. Doc. and see what further developments of the ritual might be possible. 
Jen, two solid insights. A lot of mythologies have a period of primal peace and relative stasis at the beginning, so Eden isn’t a bad metaphor for the metaphor. As for Fortune’s idea of God, we’ll be getting to that in rather more detail, and a less Miltonic God than the one in the Cos. Doc. is hard to imagine!
Zach, a lovely bit of Blake! Thank you. 
Temporaryreality, I suspect the reason that Fortune used the phrase “interstellar space” is that human beings can’t actually imagine emptiness except in relation to things that aren’t filling it. Remember that she’s not saying that the Unmanifest is interstellar space, or even is like interstellar space — just that we, with our limited capacities, can best imagine it that way. As for your second dilemma, the text requires both — moving back and forth between understanding it as literally as possible, and treating that understanding as a metaphor, is the process by which it unfolds its meaning. 
Tenchu13, good. That shows me that you’re actually grappling with it. If your copy ends up flying across the room once per chapter, or more, that’s not a problem, so long as you keep on wrestling it to the ground. 
Steven, thank you! 
Dirtyboots, don’t shake that sense. It’s a good way to think about the Ring-Chaos. 
DutyBound, thanks for this! I’ve got a publisher working out the details of a new printing of the revised edition right now, so there should be good news shortly. 
Johnny, I don’t think anyone’s ever done an existentialist analysis of the Cos. Doc., but it’s certainly an option!
Docshibby, if all you see in this book is a rehash of Asian ideas, that may not be the book’s fault. I’d encourage you to follow the advice of the famous Zen master and try emptying your cup so you can enjoy the taste of Dion Fortune’s English tea…
Mark, excellent. Yes, that’s very much what Fortune is talking about. It’s the same strategy used in aikido and some of the other, subtler martial arts; you don’t block a punch or a kick, you’re just not there where it lands, so the energy is expended in empty space. 
Sidney, welcome to the journey! 
Varun, a very solid point! “May God us keep from single vision and Newton’s sleep…”
Johnny, yes, if you’re standing in line with the points at which the two Rings cross. As for IS, it’s quite possible! 
Jean-Pierre, that should be fine. You may find some interesting crossovers between the two — as well as some very deliberate differences.

If the Unmanifest is perfectly stable and without history why would a first current occur or an initial ‘destruction’ happen?
It has to be inherently unstable.  Or it could be mainly about time and not about space, maybe space is just a byproduct,  a manifestation of time. Because if we picture a ring it would never begin or end- but how could one imagine any begin with no starting point?
It is very challenging to even consider something existing that never began.
Concerning the plane of the first ring: It forms a current, is the current really aligned in only one plane? Imagine any and infinite amount of elements of the Unmanifest begin to move in infinite and random directions each individually constrained by own anti-force, it would create an infinitely dense sphere right away. Also would consequently each element receive its own chaos ring or would a chaos sphere – also random and infinite – enclose the cosmos?
Thank you for this space.







 Ray Wharton says:

I have been grinding on the chapter a bit more, mostly getting pulled off in the direction of various philosophical riddles that I been on my mind’s shelf for a decade or more, which excepting an infection point in the beginning lead pretty far from the text as such; an example would be a project of inverting the chain of being such that the higher one goes ‘up’ the chain the more we are dealing with reflections of reflections, to put the point in symbolism, but that those reflections being further from the unmanifest -indeed reflections of reflections could be rendered as manifestations of manifestations with only slight violence to the terms- they ironically do a good job of symbolizing very profound truths. The image of this is to imaging looking for a light source by observing rays which have bounced off a long series of smoked (dim) mirrors. If you see light after so many dimming reflections, and (this is tricky) can be confident that the light you see isn’t a contamination of the observation, then you can be confident that what you are observing was, before the reflections a very bright light source. Perhaps, nod to Plato, a light source too bright to observe directly with our cave addled eyes. Math has some truths like this, even moderately abstract mathematics is fantastically abstract from the sense experience and everyday concepts which gave rise to them, and yet despite coming out of a hall of mirrors or abstractions tested against abstraction for consistency, we end up with concepts so powerful they were the gold standard of truth for a vast multitude of great thinkers. But, this was on the shelf, and came out rather all at once trying to figure out how we could even ‘dare’ to talk about such lofty things as the emanations of the logos or, shutter, the unmanifest.
Closer to the text something that has been stuck in my crawl has been working loose by the talk of “unequal forces”. First I came to realize that Newton, who does deserve much respect in his own right, made a meme too strong. “Equal and opposite reaction.” Golly does that roll off the tongue! Equal and opposite reaction is a bugger of a bright insight, and it is so sayable, thinkable, that it has left DEEP ruts in the roads of my mind, and I betcha deep ruts in the minds of most folks with any serving of rationalist training. Good ruts too, if you are going that direction. For example, in your own MTOTLE your section on causality uses the same byways. The sum of the causes have to (in some sense) be equal to the sum of the effects; a principle of sufficient reason for something to happen if you please. But, I now come to the problem with that great tract by Newton, the cross roads to it, with are a gummed up in my thinking by those very deep and well traveled ruts. I am so used to thinking of the equality of action and reaction, that I can forget that every action is an inequality of forces. Imagine an orbit of perfect balance:
A system includes object A and object B. They are attracted to each other by gravity, such that escape velocity is x. They are moving exactly away from one another at such at that precise speed, and no other forces are in the picture. So in a straight line they continue to move away from each other with the velocity constantly approaching zero, but never quite reaching it. Eventually the force of gravity between them and the velocity of separation reach an equalized infidecimal. That is Newton with only equal and opposite forces. A silly image. All equal and opposite forces, as opposed to reactions, are static. They gridlock.
All manifestation is based on some kind of inequality; a difference. Manifestation is entirely dependent on differentiation. But each difference is preserved, a difference can not (via Newton) be equalized with out differentiating something else. This is the birth of information, and manifestation, by way of Bateson. Also, and this bit I am still chewing on, because I don’t quite know what to do with it, differentiation does not birth a duality but a three fold: The two that are not the same, and that to which they are different. I think that this third factor, consider it the filter of maya if you please, is what kicks differentiation to manifestation. The third factor is in and of the first two which are distinct from one another, but, it is needfully of a different ‘logical type’ than the first two; a difference of forces is not the same kind of thing as the forces which are different; a difference is a relation and in a way more primary than the forces which are merely things related, aspects of the relation one could say. I am itching on this like the dawn of consciousness glows from the breaking of these unmanifest atoms. But there is still a great deal of mess here to sort out.

I’m working from an un-paragraphed PDF, so this is a little hard to relate to paragraphs and pages in the print versions.  But here goes:
“When this secondary movement has completed its first circuit and set up its steady revolution, the new Cosmos is in being. ”
That new cosmos would seem to be a sphere inside the ring-cosmos.
“The secondary spin of the first circuit (Ring-Cosmos) is the Ring-Pass-Not, and the circuit of the second formation (Ring-Pass-Not?) is that sphere which sets a bound to Chaos. On the outer sphere there is a secondary derivation, and though a spinning circle of motion, represents for that Cosmos, the prime stillness, – the immobility in which it is rooted;”
Secondary spin = the result of the attraction and repulsion of the sides of ring-cosmos to ring-chaos.
Second formation = ring-pass-not?  
Outer sphere = ring-pass-not?  
Movement represents stillness.
Again, that would imply that an inner sphere exists and is the new cosmos.
So we have a cosmos, surrounded by a ring, surrounded by a sphere beyond which we cannot see, surrounded by another ring.  The first ring pushes to the center and causes the cosmos, a universe, to form.  The second ring pushes outward, disposing of…something.  
And then ring-chaos comes to symbolize the prime evil, despite being second to ring-cosmos in order of formation.
You’ve said that DF uses “evolution” in a “nuanced” way.  It appears the same can be said of “inertia”, “momentum”, and “right angle”.
Inertia and momentum are both resistance to acceleration, either positive and negative.  This caused me pause.  Also, she appears to switch back and forth between scalar and vector without warning, which I call “shifting paradigms without a clutch”.  In a Newtonian sense, inertia has no vector, but momentum does.  That would be the one difference.  (In a relativistic universe, both have vectors relative to the observer and each other.) Yet in her system, inertia is a vector 90 degrees off from the motion, inducing a curve to the path and eventually a ring.
Once the two rings are up to speed, the inner ring starts to flip like a coin, axis spinning around in a plane that includes the axes of the inner and outer rings.   But that means that while the rings are occasionally, briefly, at 90 degrees from each other, most of the time they are not.  Yet she still refers to them as being 90 degrees to each other.
I feel like I’ve missed something there.  My one reassurance is that this system has worked for others.

I am finding a great deal of differences between texts.  The edition that says its the millennial edition  I have has the Unmanifest begin on page 33 and the seemingly older one saying its published in 1947 starts on page 11 which matches the reading assignment.  I like that the millennial edition has nice embedded links to the figures, which are helpful, and the figures in the 1947 version seem clearer.  Both are electronic versions, which I can pick up at bedside anytime and read without disturbing my wife, rather than turning on a light or escaping to another spot to do the reading. I also find there is an error in the 1947 and the millennial versions’ figures 1-4.  The descriptions say figure 1 is the Ring Chaos, and Figure 2 is the Ring Chaos.  When clearly the drawing figures say that figure 1 is the Ring Cosmos, and figure 2 is the Ring Chaos.  Is this difference significant or a typo?  Being a newbie to the study, I have no basis for choosing one over the other and don’t know if it is significant or not.
  There is a great deal of additional text in the millennial edition that does not appear in the 1947 edition.  For example section one in the millennial edition begins with “Knowledge falls into two divisions,” and in chapter 1, the 1947 edition begins with “The Unmanifest is pure existence.”
  The millennial edition also has a huge index, and three more diagrams.
   My questions are should I invest in a print edition where the diagrams may be clearer with the hopes of addressing the same information from which you are leading this forum, or are the editions I have sufficient to follow along and gather the necessary reading skills?  And whether the differences in the texts will enhance or detract from my practices of these metaphors?
  The commentary has been illuminating.  Thank you all for your contributions.
  In my effort to understand the spinning discs of the diagram called out as figure A, I cannot understand how the contents of these two different discs do not interfere with one another, except as creating currents that attract and repel, except to say that the older and smaller one has nothing in it except the Unmanifest, which by definition is empty and meaningless so offers no resistance to the second induced movement of the ring chaos and its interface with the ring cosmos, the ring pass not.  Oh what fun!

So, nothing from inside the cosmos can get out past the Ring-Pass-Not (RPN). But can things from outside it get in? DF talks about evil tending toward dissolution (being drawn back toward the Ring-Chaos) but it can’t get back out. Presumably it had to come through the RPN to get from the RChaos into the RCosmos in the first place. But once inside it is trapped, and so dissipates into the raw material of existence (neutrality) and is drawn into the motion of the RCosmos, becoming good. This implies a gradual increase of good inside the RCosmos. Good meaning something like complexity, order–is this at least partially what DF means by evolution? Biological evolution too tends toward increasing complexity/differentiation over time.







 John Roth says: 



								June 24, 2018 at 11:48 pm							




@Larry
Yes, there are a lot of differences, but not quite as many as it appears if you only look at Chapter 1. Most of the text after the actual reading assignment in Chapter 1 got moved into Chapter 2 in the Revised (1947) edition.

Except for Lovecraftian monsters? That’s the way I read it.

Hi JMG,
It’s been interesting to keep re-reading this same section of text.  I have done some slow readings before, but not this slow.  It does something unusual that I don’t know how to describe.
The main idea in this chapter seems to be that potential can be thought of as an existing thing, in fact it is the most real thing, all else is temporary and an illusion.  It can be contemplated by comparing it to interstellar space, a void that encompasses all that we know and that we exist inside of.  I don’t know what to do with this, but comparing it to things that seemed similar at first, like Schoppenhauer’s concept of The Will helped me to see that it is it’s own unique idea.  The Will is still a useful concept, but it is not describing the same thing.  I’m not sure what can be done with this notion of the Unmanifest, but it is interesting.
The idea that motion and stillness are the ultimate duality is also unique, it isn’t thought and extension (for example – her choice of the word duality I assume is pointed at this notion in philosophy).  This is the primary form of manifestation, are all other forms of manifestation derived from this split?
What seems most useful so far has been contemplating the mechanics of the rings she describes. The relationships she describes between an action and potential are very useful and when I think about them I can see many examples where they seem to be true.  I think the idea that there are always two opposing forces at work in everything, and that the weaker one ultimately is what limits and defines the stronger one is very interesting.  That there is a connection between limitations and creativity, that desire uses it to push off from is quite insightful and something I have noticed often in art.
I have something like 15 pages of notes on this now, but I’ll keep at it.  I try to return to the image of a current in space as she said it is the key to much.
Thanks,
Johnny

Hi JMG,
I wanted to say thanks for your help with this.  I had a question about the Logos.
Is the Logos in her system the idea of concepts?  The ground for the set of all concepts, with individual ideas as it’s “Solar system”.  Or is it just the thrust of any given concept, and the relationship of other concepts (or maybe just events, things etc) flowing from it?
Or is it perhaps the very idea of the Cosmic Doctrine?  On the cover of my copy there is a sun emitting rays into space (not a larger picture of space).
Will she expand on this?  She just mentions it casually, that it can be imaged as a sun surrounded by it’s solar system, emitting rays, but she doesn’t go into more detail.
What I took to be the important part was that all of this exists within space.
Thanks,
Johnny

I seem to have a 3rd printed edition published in 1995, but ‘first published’ in 1949. It seems to be identical to that reported by Larry for the ‘millennial edition’, except for the page numbers. “Knowledge falls into two divisions” then starts on page 19. I am now sticking to the downloaded pdf text ‘Revised and Enlarged Edition, THE AQUARIAN PRESS,LONDON.1957’, which starts “The unmanifest is pure existence.” on page 11.
Re Ray Wharton’s musing, above. We understand in this DF context, the use of ‘physics’ vocabulary concerning ‘movement’ is intended to be ‘symbolic’, rather than designed to inform. It seems to me, if we extend the ‘physics’ vocabulary, we need the concept of ‘acceleration’. And to continue the analogy further (to get our heads round a concept such as ‘force’), we need ‘energy’, as for example in kinetic energy. And we need to differentiate acceleration from simply ‘movement’. Thus continued acceleration is concomitant with continued increase in energy, even in a frictionless world. Then we could get into the mystery of gravity acting at a distance which apparently bothered Newton’s critics. And I sadly can’t compare DF’s physics (intended as analogies for training rather than information) with Einstein’s physics! Smile.

@Jen and John Roth,
Makes sense but the ” thermodynamics” of ever increasing goodness is hard to figure.  If we assume that his is a system whose nature is to seek equilibrium, there should be a corresponding increase in evil somewhere in the system.  Does the Ring Chaos grow for every increment of goodness that accrues to the cosmos?  I’m probably missing a key point.

The details of Fortune’s imagery are metaphors, but what are they metaphors for?
For better or worse this seems to be my characteristic reaction to many occult doctrines. Teachers want me to study elaborate metaphors, understandably because most people apparently have never done so, but what’s behind the curtain? Part of the issue might be I’ve already developed and extensively contemplated my own comparably elaborate metaphors. (I could write chapters about how the conscious universe results from the dynamic interplay between two entities, the Vortex and the Void, whose fundamental impetus is to fill and annihilate one another respectively, and for which the M.C. Escher lithograph “Print Gallery” is a reasonable visual metaphor. Not too dissimilar from portions of Fortune’s imagery, if inverted inward-outward, which is a simple mathematical transformation.)
But consider me signed up to go along with Fortune’s instead. So here goes…
Given that the purpose of contemplating Fortune’s imagery is to train the mind, then it seems likely that the metaphor is, at least in large part, for how the mind (or consciousness or will) itself works.
To the extent that it’s human minds we’re talking about, it’s easy to find analogies to various thought processes in Fortune’s Rings model. Consider the simple (which is not at all simple) mental act of putting things (including e.g. ideas and experiences) into categories. Categories accrete instances and representations (let’s say, a Ring-Cosmos of “chairs”) but that inevitably also establishes a Ring-Chaos of the excluded (non-chairs). Attraction and repulsion at the boundary (arising from figurative borderline cases: doll house chairs? accidental rock formations on a mountain side? conceptual-art sculptures with spikes on the “seat”?) means the category-cosmos cannot be static; tumbling on an additional axis is as good a metaphor for that as any. Nothing outside the resulting Ring-Pass-Not of Chairs can be a chair.
Fortune’s Ring-Pass-Not, then, bounds all categories.
That analogy generalizes pretty well, because at the very least, all words and all names are (or generate) categories. Self is a category. Good and evil as we perceive them are categories (though Fortune seems to be implying that actual evil, when fully understood in general, is not). We can’t contemplate beyond the Ring-Pass-Not because anything we can contemplate (even e.g. “a four-sided triangle” or “things that don’t exist”) still amount to or require categories. (It also follows that we cannot actually contemplate the Prime Evil.)
Does it follow that we (or others) can pass the Ring-Pass-Not when we (or they) can think or exist without categories?

News flash: for the first time today, I could see the three ring movements simultaneously. I wasn’t even deep in meditation- just rereading the text and thinking it over- and there it was. Of course, just as simple as watching the gears in a clock all clicking along, each in their own direction. Further evidence that things happen beneath the surface.
I’m chewing over the image of the Ring-Pass-Not today. I understand where it is in relationship to the other two rings, and how it’s formed. What I’m pondering is, what is its nature as a boundary? It doesn’t seem to be just a zone where the Ring-Chaos and the Ring-Cosmos just fade into each other, like day gradually fading into night. It’s a hard boundary, through which creatures of the Ring-Cosmos cannot pass. But the two other rings interact within it, or rather it is FORMED by their interaction, like… What? I need a metaphor for the metaphor! Is it like a membrane? Not exactly, because then it would be made out of the Ring-Cosmos, from which it is actually separate. Is something like the squishy repulsion you can feel between the same poles of two magnets, two fields pushing each other apart and making a sort of no-man’s land? (I’ll confess I don’t really, truly understand the nature of magnetic forces either.) Is it just like a hard, infinitely thin crystal sphere, a clean sharp edge between the two other rings, but made up of neither? With that metaphor you lose the interaction between them… Maybe the interference pattern of two waves? In the sense that it’s not one ring or the other, but they both cease to be what they are when they interact? Anyone got a helpful image here? Will we hear more from DF about the Ring-Pass-Not later on in the book?
And one other question about the Ring-Pass-Not: It’s the sphere described by the edge of the Ring-Cosmos’s disk as the Ring-Cosmos turns over within the Ring-Chaos. But the Ring-Chaos is a stationary “belt” with respect to this flipping motion, like a flowing equator around this sphere. So since (as noted in the comments above) the interacting forces that create the Ring-Pass-Not are sometimes in the same plane, sometimes orthogonal, and sometimes at every other angle in between with respect to each other- is the Ring-Pass-Not’s sphere uniform throughout, or does it also have some sort of cyclical variation within itself? And then what are the implications of THAT?

What first came to mind in reading about the Unmanifest is the following (in a modern translation) from The Book of Privy Counsel(l)ing, which, despite its name, has nothing to do with politics.
“When you go apart to be alone for prayer, put from your mind everything you have been doing or plan to do. Reject all thoughts, be they good or be they evil. … See that nothing remains in your conscious mind save a naked intent stretching out toward God. Leave it stripped of every particular idea about God (what he is like in himself or in his works) and keep only the simple awareness that he is as he is. Let him be thus, I pray you, and force him not to be otherwise. … Let that quiet darkness be your whole mind and like a mirror to you. For I want your thought of self to be as naked and as simple as your thought of God, so that you may be spiritually united to him without any fragmentation and scattering of your mind. He is your being and in him, you are what you are, not only because he is the cause and being of all that exists, but because he is your cause and the deep center of your being. Therefore, in this contemplative work think of your self and of him in the same way: that is, with the simple awareness that he is as he is, and that you are as you are. In this way your thought will not be fragmented or scattered, but unified in him who is all.
“Yet keep in mind this distinction between yourself and him: he is your being but you are not his. It is true that everything exists in him as in its source and ground of being, and that he exists in all things, as their cause and their being. Yet a radical distinction remains: he alone is his own cause and his own being. For as nothing can exist without him, so he cannot exist without himself. He is his own being and the being of everything else. Of him alone may this be said; and thus he is wholly separate and distinct from every created thing. And thus, also, he is one in all things and all things are one in him. For I repeat: all things exist in him; he is the being of all.”
Now, it might be tempting to equate God in this text with the Unmanifest, but there is the Ring-Pass-Not to contend with. While I can “kinda” think about how one might get around this, because DF writes “All we can say of IT is that it is not anything that we know”, and our anonymous fourteenth-century English author had previously written a book entitled The Cloud of Unknowing, I’m more inclined, and really looking forward, to seeing how all of this plays out.

I have been meditating on the concept of inertia, the pull against movement.  I’ve meditated on and off about the concept in MToTLE of limits being a source of beauty and magic, but the best I could come up with was more ways to work around my limitations.  So the concept of this pull against movement intrigued me.  I often feel my limitations as a drag against what I’m trying to do, rather than the feeling of bumping up against something (although that happens, too). 
I meditated on it a bit, then finally took my meditations to the yoga mat.  It occurred to me that every movement my body makes has a corresponding pull, every stretch has a corresponding flexion in an opposing muscle group.  If I do something as simple as raise my arms above my head, they don’t flop and hit me because of the opposing forces.  I can move effectively because of these oppositions, not in spite of them.  Anyone who has done yoga, or danced (or maybe martial arts; I haven’t studied any) knows that sweet spot where the breath is singing through the body, the stretches and flexions are working together without a fight between them, and just enough energy is expended, wasting none.
I wondered how I could get traction from opposition instead of seeing it as a block, and yet my body does it all the time.  Every time I bring a cup of tea to my lips the opposing muscle forces that allow me to do it are (metaphorically) participating in the dance of creation.  I’m still working on what that might mean in other areas.  
That’s as far as I’ve gotten in a week.  Am I missing the point?

Hi JMG,
Often I find myself holding two opposing ideas at the same time, typically I agree with one more than the other, but the one I agree with less does limit the one I agree with more.  It shapes the edges of the argument I am in favour of – it can only go so far and no more.  I think this is an example of this in my day to day experience.
Thanks,

Hi JMG,
It occurred to me yesterday that sometimes the desire to manifest must be less that the power of inertia.  In fact most of the time this must be true.  Is Fortune interested or concerned with this?  Or is the Unmanifest exactly what I’m describing?  Is everything trying to manifest all the time but is unable to overcome inertia except in special cases?
Thanks,
Johnny

A thought that came to mind: If the Ring Pass-Not is an effect of the Ring Cosmos pushing off of and pulling towards the Ring Chaos, which is what actually creates the Ring Pass-Not in its rotation, isn’t the Ring Pass-Not, in a sense, an illusion? 
It is not a thing in and off itself, but just the perceived effect of the Ring Chaos’s forced rotation, the way a ceiling fan at high speed will look like a solid disk. If the metaphor stretches that far, then there is a way in and out of the Ring Pass-Not, but in order to avoid getting… blasted to cosmic dust by the force of the Ring Chaos, you would have to either have a form capable of withstanding the impact or be able to see and move between the actual gaps quick enough. 
Is that an ability achieved at a certain level of spiritual evolution? A variant on what we might call “enlightenment?”







 Dirtyboots says: 



								June 26, 2018 at 2:17 pm							




One possibility is that the Ring Cosmos and Ring Choas form a dinergic pair of alternating dominance.  At time 0, when the RCh and RCo are orthogonal, the system is in equilibrium and the forces of growth and dissolution are balanced.  As the RCo rotates, the forces favoring growth increase relative to those favoring dissolution, such that at time time point 1 (t1) the rings are aligned and growth is exuberant.  As the RCo rotates further the forces of growth wane and maturity/consolidation ensues, until the RCo has “flipped” and is now in a new state (t2) of equilibrium with the RCh.
The RCo then enters a new phase of its rotation during which it follows a course back toward the initial state of equilibrium.  During this return phase, the forces favoring dissolution become dominant and eliminate that which accrued during the growth phase.
Rinse and repeat, world after world.

The Ring Chaos, it seems to me, is pretty far ‘off-screen’ in our lives. I was farm sitting again last weekend and it was a total mess! Every time I turned around the tenuous order of the operation was threatening to fall into chaos. Cows getting out, a malfunctioning sprinklers, failing electric fence, pigs out, sheep out, unexpected lamb, dog fight, the works. It was as though the drag of the Ring chaos snagged a thread which ran through the fabric of the farm and pulled it into a tangle. I was working my butt off responding to each crisis, playing a lot to triage with overlapping problems, and took a moment to be amused by the fact that I was capable of reacting constructively to such a mess at all. Then I realized that for how chaotic the situation seemed, it was still deeply richly ordered. Each cow, for days on end, continued to be a cow and act entirely within the rubric for cow kind; so to for pigs, sheep, and chickens. Only the irrigation pump really failed to act like what it was, and that was because a single variable (the amount of water flowing through the weir) was slightly out of parameter.
The issue was that the farm itself, being very recently established had many patterns that were not very deeply whirled into the spinning wheel of positive being, the ring cosmos, but the ply it was spun from (grass, cows, sheep, etc) were each very well spun, and persisted in being what they were even as the farm became a mess. Even when the situation was messy in the extreme, the thinks it became were still know types, a total mess is still ripe with order, a farm gone haywire is a known ‘type’, so typical is it that the topic can be easily recognized in farce with the slightest imagistic prompting.
In a way I would even go so far as to say that the dragging effect from the ring chaos has a more or less cleansing aspect to it. For example the electric fences were a total mess at the peak of the cacophony, but the situation forced the messed up fencing to be pulled down and then put back up in a much more tidy way.

If the cosmos, chaos and ring pass not are all empty space, which when it moves creating attraction and repulsion, then the empty contents, metaphorically can, and do pass one another.  One cannot have spinning spheres that interact sometimes as discs with positive and negative sides pivoting at all possible angles to one another, 90 degrees opposed, with a no pass boundary between them unless they actually pass through one another. That passing through one another is tricky.  How do the forces not mix and homogenize?  What keeps them as entities even though they are intimate? What happens to that which is not unmanifest?  Like Duality?  I guess that is what we will find out as we continue our journey.
I awoke this morning thinking about epigenetics, as the answer to why the genome’s failure to explain all of our chromosomal traits, and the ring pass not and the cell membrane. The insides of our cells [Cosmos] interacts with but is separate from the outside of the cells [Chaos], with this very thin entity, the cell membrane in between, which acts as a barrier to stuff going in and out of our cells.  When the universe of conditions are right, needed stuff passes between the outside and inside, and then inside, passes to the organelles in rather obscure ways, but only under the very strict conditions of environment. I guess this activity is actually happening in the manifest part of our cosmos, because it is not part of the unmanifest, because we are manifest.  Just think about what repellent forces are required to produce and utilize digestive fluid without destroying the entire structure.  I am starting to imagine what this means in terms of immense distances, and eons of time, and counter rotational movements of space slower than a glacial advance and faster than a speeding cosmic ray.
Thanks Ray Wharton for the description of the interplay of good and evil, and the structure that exists transcending and forming new solutions and making things better in the presence of “evil.”  
I’m asking myself if I’m starting to grasp this or just going off the deep end?







 Johnny says: 



								June 28, 2018 at 11:51 am							




Hi JMG,
The example Fortune gives of space starting to turn, that is a description of the initial motion that gave rise to manifestation, this same thing happens when anything manifests itself, but in that case it is different as there is always something already manifest, there are already forces in existence.  These forces must also contribute towards manifestation, we can divide the manifest from the Unmanifest because the point where it crosses into the manifest is obvious to us, but behind the scenes there is a push and pull of forces that are not always producing results..
Let’s say I want to get a ball to touch a wall. If I throw the ball at the wall, that takes much less desire from me than for me to pick it up and walk it over to the wall and press it against it, because when I throw it my desire only had to drive a quick motion and then the laws of physics take over, where if I need to pick it up and carry it over it has to sustain a far greater effort and therefore a far greater resistance.  When I throw it I take advantage of a lot of already manifested things to push the balance.
Am I right?  Can other (already manifested) forces contribute to the spin of the Ring-Cosmos?
Thanks,
Johnny

Hi JMG,
Something I’ll add about this process.  I find that thinking about this daily, re-reading it, and meditating on it has caused this line of thought and metaphor to invade my thinking generally.  It’s partially because the scope of what she’s describing entails everything and posits something new that engulfs that everything.  There isn’t any time it isn’t applicable, but also, because it is a metaphor it’s just a way of looking at anything that has happened or could happen.
I also feel like answers to questions are given out of order in the text, so sometimes I’ll hit upon an idea, like what I asked you about all the times things aren’t manifest and then reread her line that the Unmainifest was the Great Negation.
Thanks,
Johnny

@Johnny: I’m experiencing the same effect, of the metaphor gently filtering its way into my daily life. The idea that every initiative generates its own resistance, so you always get pulled off course but still continue forward, is really comforting. It’s also contrary to the heroic ideal of achievement in our society, where the hero takes aim and proceeds straight towards their goal through force of personality and will. 
It’s been a bit of a change to have to come back to the imagery day after day, gnaw at it like a dog on a hard bone, then come back tomorrow for a bit more chewing. Each chew pulls out a tiny bit more juice, but it takes a deliberate effort to slow down and take the book line by line on its own terms. Fortunately we’re only doing a chapter a month!

Hello JMG,
I have two questions I’ve been gnawing on for a while but to no avail.
Both relate to the last paragraph on page 21 (millenium edition). In the paragraph before that, DF writes of the “secondary movement …completed its first circuit” – so, the Ring-Cosmos, under attraction to Ring-Chaos, begins to flip/spin spherically to create Ring-Pass-Not. She says as much in the next paragraph, but I’m having trouble with her continued wording there:
“The secondary spin of the first circuit refers to the Ring-Pass-Not, and the circuit of the second formation is that sphere which sets a bound to Chaos.”
To which second formation is she referring? The new whole comprised of the three rings? and what “circuit” is it making? Nowhere else is it suggested (and here only obliquely) that the whole shebang is also spinning on an axis – but it seems to be conceived that way to come up with something transcribing the “bounds of stillness.” Am I on the right track?
Secondly, is the prime stillness – rooted in immobility- another word for Unmanifest as that which was unmoving until some portion wasn’t and set this whole thing in motion? 
If this prime stillness is the thrust block of the Cosmos and alone enables momentum, is this implying that Unmanifest has a quality of being “thrust block?” This contradicts its quality-less-ness or maybe this is actually a description of something else “outside” the new Cosmos and its bounding rings. If I’m reading it correctly, though, she calls this Ring Chaos (which previously had only been created as a reaction TO (not initiator of) Ring Cosmos.
Kinda tangled… 
I very much appreciate any insight or nudges in particular directions you can offer.

Hi all!
I’ve jumped in on the book club this week and thought I would share my take on the first couple paragraphs.
I found myself thinking of the pre-big bang state.  It’s a kind of void where there isn’t even time in the way we percieve it. I see it as multidimensional.
Adding some dimensions makes the visualization more challenging,but I think lends some subtlety to the arrangement that leads in interesting directions.

If my minds eye is correct, when in Disc mode, the discs sweep space and intermingle, because the discs transcend boundaries, even the ring no pass with its infinitesimally small boundary sweeps through all the other rings.  And, I also see concentric spheres and in that case, the Discs making up each one are more like Saturn rings or frisbees with no centers, and since they are traveling within the confines of their spherical spaces, only influence one another by the movement, inertia interactions [“communicate its movement to the space around it” ]  Which is the proper model metaphor?  It’d seem that the latter fits better.  What do you all think?

One note before I start responding: I’m really impressed by the seriousness with which so many people are pursuing this project. I won’t have that much to say to a lot of the longer and more thoughtful posts, since what’s happening is that you’re grappling with the ideas in the text and it’s my job to stay out of the way and let you follow your meditations wherever they take you. 
Docshibby, you’re welcome. 
Temporaryreality, we did indeed!
Anne, those are good questions, but remember that this is a metaphor, and it’s a specific metaphor meant to communicate specific ways of thinking. To some extent, to get into the metaphor, you simply have to accept that movement in space started, and that it formed a disk. 
Ray, excellent!
Scomber, good. You’re paying ample attention. I don’t think Fortune had enough of a mathematics background to realize that she was mixing scalar and vector descriptions in a confusing way. The thing that works for most people is simply to bracket the apparent contradictions and try to convert as much as possible into visual metaphor. 
Larry, the versions you have should be fine. The text differs but the visual metaphors are the same, and the latter are the things that count. Yes, there’s a typo! The diagram in the millennium edition is confusing, because it makes it look as though the Ring-Chaos extends all the way to the center like the Ring-Cosmos, and the text makes it clear that this doesn’t happen — the Ring-Chaos diffuses outward, the Ring-Cosmos concentrates inward. 
Jen, I don’t believe Fortune ever talks about things from outside the Ring-Pass-Not getting in. We’ll get further into what good is as we proceed! 
Johnny, excellent! I well recall the first time I really focused on a text, going back and forth over it — and yes, the possibilities just keep on unfolding. As for the Logos, no, it’s not the idea of concepts — here again, we’ll get to that in quite some detail a little later on. 
Phil, very good indeed. 
Walt, the mind is certainly one of the things to which Fortune’s metaphors can apply. Can you imagine a set of general metaphors that can be applied to every category of human experience, to open up ways of thinking about human experience that we don’t normally get from our culture and education? 
Heather, those are great. Keep on pursuing them. 
Squalembrato, fascinating. I wonder to what extent it’s the shared tradition of negative theology that’s making common ground here — as Fortune was highly familiar with the English tradition of Christian mysticism — and to what extent it’s a shared experience. 
Maria, no, you’re square on target. Follow it further! 
Johnny, good! Follow both those out further. 
Jean-Pierre, no, heading toward outer space is in Fortune’s vision the opposite of enlightenment. We’ll get to that. 
Dirtyboots, good. Keep following that train of thought. 
Ray, excellent! You just keep on nailing it. 
Larry, I’m not sure those are two different things. 😉 Interesting that you mention epigenesis; Fortune will have a fair amount to say about that as we proceed. 
Johnny, I’m just going to sit back and smile at this point. 
Temporaryreality, the sphere of the second formation is the Ring-Pass-Not — the implication is that the Ring-Cosmos has two movements, its original movement (the flowing of space that forms it) and its secondary rotation imparted by the attraction and repulsion of the Ring-Chaos. The Prime Stillness is the Ring-Chaos, and that’s also the thrust-block against which the Ring-Cosmos rotates. Does that help? 
Deadnettlez, thanks for this. 
Wesley, good. Now follow Fortune’s metaphors and see where they take you. 
Larry, oddly enough, we’ll get to the concentric circles in a couple of months. As the Ring-Cosmos develops, it sorts itself out into concentric rings around a central stillness. More on this as we proceed. 
Abdulaziz, I admit I wouldn’t have thought of trying to correlate the Cos. Doc. and Liber AL, but if that works for you, by all means!







 Jen says: 



								July 4, 2018 at 5:10 am							




JMG, hmm! I shall have to wait on further speculation about goodness and evolution, then. 
The final problem I have hunted out in my understanding of the imagery comes at the end of the chapter: “The secondary spin of the first circuit is the Ring-Pass-Not, and the circuit of the second formation is that sphere which sets a bound to Chaos. On the outer sphere there is a secondary derivation, and though a spinning circle of motion, represents for that Cosmos, the prime stillness,”
So I get how the sphere of the Ring-Pass-Not is formed, but my issue is with “the circuit of the second formation is that sphere which sets a bound to Chaos. On the outer sphere . . .” 
This makes it sound as if there are two spheres being described, with the inner sphere being the Ring-Pass-Not, and the outer sphere being the Ring-Chaos, except that the Ring-Chaos is not a sphere. So is the outer sphere a sort of imaginary globe of which the Ring-Chaos is the equator? It sort of sounds as if the Ring-Chaos is also spinning in a similar manner to the Ring-Cosmos and thus describing a second sphere, but my understanding is that the Ring-Chaos is stationary on its axis.
Thank you for your patience and the time and effort you are putting into this discussion!

In your comment to Temporaryreality, you mentioned the Ring-Cosmos has two movements.
Glancing through _Paths of Wisdom_, I saw references to “continuous creation” in the back.
Is this simply a byproduct of motion within the Ring-Cosmos, or can the whole Ring-Structure
“breathe” through exchanges with the surrounding Unmanifest?







 Cliff says: 



								July 4, 2018 at 10:38 pm							




Fortune says that ‘Space’ and ‘Movement’ is the prime duality, but I feel like there’s another candidate: The distinction between Unmanifest and Manifest. As soon as anything whatsoever (space, movement, qualities wholly alien to human experience, etc.) manifests, there you would have a duality between Unmanifest and Manifest.
I don’t know if I would go so far to say as this duality is distinct or prior to Space and Movement; rather, the two seem synonymous in some way when I consider the matter.
Also, along the lines of what Sven Eriksen was wondering about in the Open Post, it seems like there’s a strain of thought within Buddhism (or at least whatever versions of it we’ve got here in the States) that leads towards the Unmanifest. As in, the Buddhist void and the Unmanifest seem to bear a striking resemblance, at least to my untrained eyes.

@Kfish  
I would think the hero myth still applies.  The hero is shaped by adversity, but their will is strong enough to manifest their goals.  The point I think is that there aren’t any straight lines and so their victory at the end of their journey does not look like the picture of success they had in the beginning.  I could be wrong though!

Hi JMG,
Thanks.  I was afraid I was just spamming your comments so I stopped posting, but did not stop thinking about this.  And in particular this idea of the accumulation of forces.
It ended up fusing with an idea I have about myself, which is that I am an accumulation of different entities that work together but also work for themselves, so my organs are telling me how they feel, and this is part of how I feel.  If something was crucial enough it would push its way all the way up the chain and become impossible to ignore – what I imagine the difference is between how I feel about my kidney now vs a person who was stabbed in their kidney.  Somehow there is some sort of democratic process based on feelings.
Consciousness is something that can also vote and can lean the vote more one way than the other.  It doesn’t get to rule things, unless none of the other parties care, but it can seemingly take control as the little bit it contributes can be the deciding factor.
Anyway, I am somehow dividable but also viewable as a whole.  In the same way it could be said that the individual motions of all the individuated pieces of the universe are both derived from the movement of manifestation as fragments of that initial motion but also constitute it.  The moment there is movement there is what Schoppenhauer identified as “the will”, which we know through it’s objectification, and as he points out, we can’t help but be caught up in the separate conflicts even though technically it is a single impulse ultimately.
The Unmanifest is separate from the Will because she is identifying a conceivable thing which has no desire or motion, no features and no history.   My trouble now is that my idea of the Unmanifest seems to amount to multiple things:  What could be, what won’t happen, what isn’t, what didn’t happen and what can’t happen – the ability to distinguish between them sounds like it breaks her very definition of it being without distinguishable qualities – so off to do some more rounds of reading this text again to try to see if the answer is there.
I have found it comic how I will make slow progress towards working through each point to understand her, and when it does click I will later see she plainly stated this discovery at some point in her text, and then of course I realize I have a new piece that isn’t fitting right.
Thanks,
Johnny

Hi JMG,
I’ve been thinking about this and I think I have an example based on doing this reading:
I want to manifest a version of myself who understands this text.  Within me, stirred by this action is a resistance.  I don’t want to change, and if I must change, I want to change as little as possible.  Ideally I’d like to read it and to just get it immediately and find out I’m right already. No matter how hard I apply myself, if I am honest, at every point when I think I’ve made some personal breakthrough with it I want to say, this is it, I understand it now, and so I can stop.  It isn’t me firing at my goal and hitting the target, this is a series of struggles against the Unmanifest’s resistance to movement.  The signs of this struggle are an indication something is happen here (and therefore more can happen).  These struggles shape what I in fact managed to manifest in myself.  These are then the “thrust blocks” that allow further manifestation to become possible.
This is what is unique I think about the way the Ring Cosmos causes the Ring Chaos in what she is describing.  This is a useful tool I think!  I had struggled initially with the Ring Chaos because I wanted to see it as gravity, a force that the Ring Cosmos swirled around, and is limited by, but it isn’t that, it’s something that pushes against it that is caused by the initial push.  This push against is also causing manifestation because it is also in motion.  This is why I can describe clearly characteristics in myself that are holding me back, the fact that these characteristics have qualities and history prove that they are manifest.
Thanks,
Johnny

The month is almost over, and … I have a new experience each time I read the text. Its been wonderfully stimulating. After an initial struggle to picture the process dynamics it began to flow together quite easily, and I chose to spend time on details contained within the visualisation process, which often morphed into real-life thoughts. I began to see that these secondary thoughts were not unrelated to the details being described in the concept. Some would dissolve, others remain unresolved but distorted, few would progress positively, and there were a couple of stand-out “clears” of realisation.  
I came back now to read your initial instruction, and found it actually all made sense, confirming my own images of the creation of the various rings. The last time I read it (one month ago) I had struggled mightily. So, thank you, this is great stuff.

Alright, when I have something really wing nut I want to add to a conversation I used to wat until comment 200 to add it. Back on TADR that put it on a back page, but that don’t work. Still I got some weird stuff I want to post about this stuff. Please be patient.
So I was thinking about the way that too many Western observers Eastern Buddhism has a distinctly nihilistic feeling; it is so easy for us to process it as a rejection of strife and a willing retreat into the unmanifest to escape the torsional pains of the Cosmos; spiritual suicide if you please. However, it is clear to me from observing Japanese culture, including those parts most influenced by Buddhism, that this is incomplete, and there is an exuberant celebration of life and its foibles that participates in all of this. Indeed that death drive is almost whipped round into the erotic.
There is a weird cultural creation from Japan that I was recently reminded of, and it is in a very very weird way a meditation on the themes of the cosmic doctrine. It is an animated cartoon, and far afield from JMG’s tastes, it is called Neon Genesis Evagelion. It is very weird, sadly too weird for me to put into words here. Suffice to say that the show presents itself as a cartoon about teenagers in giant robots that fight monsters. But all the groups of characters, the different monsters, robots, everything is quickly reveled to be an allegory for Christian metaphysics as viewed from a Japanese perspective while using the western lenses of Schopenhauer, existentialism, structuralism, and psychoanalysis. The details of how that is done go too far afield to cover here.
The climax question of the story is whether the main protagonist, a lonely and submissive young man, will choose to bring an end to the pain and strife of existence by rejecting all differentiation between manifest individuals, or choose to live on in the wake of immense trauma and lose. One one side a ‘philanthropic’ group called seele seeks to bring about an end to all suffering through him and the divine forces at play in the narrative; opposite them are the connections to his friends and family, each one very troubled, lonely, and too broken to be supporting of the main characters emotional desires. The main character chooses to preserver in life, because it is the limits and rejections made possible by others that gives him the basic structure to exist, and the opportunity to strive for authentic human connection, in spite of the separation people maintain between themselves.
That may seem far out for this topic… but I have been thinking so much about the rejection of evil, and the way that it so easily morphs into a rejection of being; that zany cartoon I think might have planted the narrative seeds in my teenage head that even today I use to make sense of some of lifes deeper pains. As a final point of context it is the kind of art that I only partake in when I am already in a gloom, as it slowly rocks that gloom into a deeper and more intense state, until finally that gloom reaches a sort of sublime beauty, and thank goodness it is over… catharsis. 
Those who want an evilless world want no world at all. Those who what to be free of sin, well Zarathustra bless them, for they shall thus pass on!
The prime evil, being at ‘cross purposes’ to the prime motion of being is inscrutable; it exists outside of the powers of our conception, excepting though negative conception (not this, not that). And yet, it is the perfect compliment of being. Any particular progress into ever more glorious forms of manifestation require an interaction, challenge, push off of the pull of a comparable inglorious thread of the ring chaos.
Order is attracted to Chaos, but cannot be lost to chaos, only divided into separated and not separated orders. The attraction to chaos is evil, giver of limitations; limitation is the mother of ten thousand beings.

Jen, that’s a confusing turn of phrase, no question. I read it as meaning “on the outside of the sphere defined by the Ring-Pass-Not,” as that makes the whole thing make sense as given. The sphere of the secondary formation is everything inside the Ring-Pass-Not — the “secondary formation” is the rotation of the Ring-Cosmos caused by the attraction of the Ring-Chaos — and the “outer sphere” is simply what’s outside that. 
Jeffrey, there’s nothing in the Unmanifest to “breathe”! The process of continuous creation, as we’ll see, unfolds within the Ring-Pass-Not as the initial movement of the Ring-Chaos becomes steadily more complex, and additional patterns take shape and interact with each other. 
Cliff, in a certain sense, yes, the distinction between the Unmanifest and Manifestation is a binary, but it’s not a duality in the strict sense, because to have a duality both sides have to be able to do something, and the Unmanifest doesn’t. It has no qualities and no history, and nothing happens to it, so it can’t interact with Manifestation to create the back and forth you need to have a duality. That’s why Space and Movement is the prime duality: each of them acts on the other. Space provides something to move, movement provides something for space to do. 
Johnny, I know the feeling. Every time I read the Cos. Doc. I find things there I didn’t notice before, and yet there they are, right in front of me in so many words…
Marco, excellent. That’s how the process of close reading of a text of occult philosophy works; it’s very good to hear that it’s worked for you. 
Ray, you’re right that I know precisely nothing of Neon Genesis Evangelion, though I’ve heard the name. The thing is, every human desire and every pattern in our consciousness sets up its own opposite in the manner you’ve sketched out. Desire for life sets in motion one Ring-Cosmos, and brings about a desire for death as a Ring-Chaos — or vice versa. Just as Christianity, the most sex-rejecting of all major religions, necessarily gave rise to the ideal of romantic love, the most sex-exalting of cultural ideologies, it comes as no surprise that the world-weariness central to historic Buddhism — “life is suffering” — would necessarily give rise to its opposite.

JMG, thanks. I shall read it that way for now, although it kind of niggles at me as describing something slightly different from the earlier imagery that I have imprinted firmly. Hopefully as we elaborate these visualizations, some of my “wobbly” conceptualizations will solidify via additional context—unless they are overwhelmed by additional confusion, heh.

Thanks for running this book club JMG, love your work, I’ve been following your blogs for aeons now and will endeavor to keep up with everyone here following the CosDoc.
The quote “We now have two spinning planes which, at two points cut each other” from the Millennium edition confused me.  and now I can see that’s absent from the revised edition.  Can I safely assume that’s an incorrect translation.  They can’t cut each other as the Ring-Chaos is outside the Ring-Cosmos and the Ring-Pass-not is between.
I got the millennium edition book, but now I’ll have to perpetually keep my eye out on a revised edition (also not a fan of reading books on computer).
Some of the comments here leave me with the impression the Ring-Chaos is the Unmanifest.
I’m sure it’s not.  As I understand, the unmanifest is the original ‘essence?’ of everything, the Ring-Cosmos, the Ring-Chaos and the Ring-Pass-not. they are all the manifestation of the unmanifest manifesting.  Which is correct? 
Lastly, I only just got the book so only just starting, so a little behind (still haven’t gone through all the comments).
When the next book club post comes out, can we ask questions related to this months post?
I believe I’m getting the visualization, but need to work on how it’s an analogy, like your example of two people interacting.

https://ello.co/brazza/post/u1oc_i8j4azmddaqv8g0sa “… this universe is a sphere encircled by two lines of force – the Ring-Cosmos and the Ring Chaos – rotating at right angles to each other. The momentum of the Ring-Cosmos is the source of force from which evolution draws its momentum; and the rotation of the Ring-Chaos is the source of force from which dissolution draws its power.”







 Fred N says: 



								July 10, 2018 at 2:25 am							




I’ve been steeped in readings on Christian thought lately, which probably explains why the Christian aspects of Fortune’s work are standing out to me, but I found that the formation of the sphere reminds me of Jesus’ story in a very abstract way – the idea of the cohering, life-giving force moving toward the entropic horizon, then past it and back around again. The cyclical spinning of the Ring-Pass-Not is very suggestive of natural cycles like birth and death (and perhaps rebirth/resurrection, depending on one’s perspective), but that detail of the good being drawn towards the evil without being negated or consumed by it rang a particularly Christian-sounding bell to me.
I’ve also been reflecting a great deal on what it might mean to say that space itself was moving. One notion that occurred to me was that the movement of space is the Unmanifest seeking to explore itself, flinging itself outward until the full range of possibilities contained within it have been realized and it returns to its origin. The motion of the Ring-Cosmos then draws those manifested realities toward the center, the point where the forces of existence are once again perfectly balanced as in the Unmanifest but have been enriched by passing through the other points on the disc. The center is then a kind of Microprosopus, a reflection within manifest reality of the Unmanifest’s ineffable perfection. Meanwhile the pull of the Ring-Chaos prevents the disc of creation from collapsing back into stasis at the center point, instead expanding the circumference so that ever more potentialities can be drawn into the ring of actuality.
…Not sure if any of that will make sense to anyone else, but it felt like a step toward comprehension at the time.  Thanks to everyone else for your own thoughts on this topic! You’ve given me lots of other angles from which to approach my inquiry.

Ok, that’s good – seems my original image/conception was on track but I just got thrown off by possible meanings.
Like KNS above, I hope to expand my ability to think analagously with the images – I can kind of pull it into personal anecdote connections, but am not so skilled at doing so on larger, topical scales.
I did find it an interesting exercise, once I had the images worked out, to go back and change wording to play with the concepts in new ways. For example, re-reading it while switching out metaphors for movement with those for “change,” thus: 
“The first manifestation was a change in space…All I can say was that [Unmanifest] was changing…Now when space changes it has this peculiar quality – being frictionless it never loses [the tendency toward] change but continues to change…When [Unmanifest] changes two forces are at work – a) the force which causes it to change, being the desire of space for change. b) the force which had hitherto caused it not to change – being the desire for space for [stasis]. These two factors are present in all change, but the desire for change, being the stronger, overcomes the desire for stasis, and the desire for stasis continues as a check upon the change…”
Also, I’m chewing on the section that says Ring-Pass-Not is prime stillness, an immobility that is the thrust block of the force the Cosmos that alone enables momentum to be achieved and contrasting that with the original _____ that allowed Unmanifest to achieve movement/momentum. Unmanifest seems to have had no thrust-block except a desire to have one against which to push off and from which to differentiate one aspect (movement vs. inertia). hmmm

In terms of translations of the Cosmic Doctrine in other languages, are there versions that some of the French or Spanish readers of this forum would recommend more than others ?  I’m currently reading the 1962 French translation from J. de la Roche.

Dion in another of her books “The Mystical Qabalah” describes Kether, Chokmah, and Binah in similar terms.  Kether is like the space before movement, Chokmah is the movement of the space, and Binah Is the restraining force that gives curvature to space.  I suppose you could take the process lower where Chesed (Gedulah) forms the Ring Cosmos, Geburah the Ring Chaos, and Tiphareth the Ring No-Pass.  If so, then there are attributes at each state of existence that are interesting.  Binah for instance could just as easily have killed Chokmah, but instead chooses to give form.  Sort of an interesting take, since the forces then brought forth are weaker, but supportive.  It has been a thought of mine that Hod could crush Netzach or be supportive.  Just as the rationality can crush the emotional or give it form.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Forces of (Negative) Evil 
July 11, 2018John Michael Greer186 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected.
As noted in earlier posts here, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 2, “The Forces of (Negative) Evil,” p. 14-17.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 1, “The First Manifestation,” from the first complete paragraph on p. 22 through the end of the chapter on p. 25.
Commentary:
The responses to last month’s post, the first in this sequence, were very heartening to me; a lot of people are clearly up to putting ample study and thought into this important occult text. Thank you all for taking this seriously! With that, let’s go on to the next set of ideas and images.
We pick up where we left off, with the Ring-Cosmos spinning in one plane, the Ring-Chaos spinning just outside it in a plane at right angles to the first, and the Ring-Pass-Not marking the boundary between them. In the diagram, the Ring-Cosmos is the light-colored ring, the Ring-Chaos the dark-colored ring, and the Ring-Pass-Not the dotted circle.
When you imagine the three rings for the purposes of this chapter, it’s helpful to keep them in this orientation, with each of them at right angles to the other two. Yes, I know that the Ring-Cosmos pivots around as shown by the little arrows, but symbolically speaking—and these are symbols, remember, meant to train the mind rather than to inform it—the rings should be imagined at right angles to one another. Much of the discussion  in this chapter will make more sense if that’s kept in mind.
The two versions of our text differ here in detail, but the basic concepts are the same in both cases. The first thing to work on, as you think your way through this chapter, is the series of distinctions between the Ring-Cosmos and the Ring-Chaos, or (which is the same thing) between evolution and devolution. (These aren’t the words I’d have used, but then I didn’t write our text.) To Fortune, “evolution” means movement toward complexity and integration, and “devolution” means movement toward simplicity and disintegration. These two factors balance each other; they are the yang and yin of the Cosmic Doctrine’s cosmos.
It’s helpful to spend some time learning to think about the universe in this way—to see every existing thing as held in balance between the centripetal force of the Ring-Cosmos and the centrifugal force of the Ring-Chaos, between the pull toward complexity and the pull toward simplicity, between integration and disintegration. That balance has a cyclic component to it, but we’ll be getting into that later in the text. For now, try to think of the world as the interplay of these two forces working at right angles to each other.
Fortune calls these forces “Good” and “Evil.” Notice, though, that she immediately undercuts that seemingly straightforward statement by saying that they “are not ‘good’ and ‘evil’ as you underestand these terms, but merely spinning circles of force at right angles to each other”. This kind of paradoxical speech is of course immensely common in occult writings, and in the writings of every other branch of spirituality that deals with states of consciousness.
She’s also doing a bait-and-switch job here, though that’s only clear from the title of the chapter in the revised edition. We’re talking about negative evil here. Negative evil? That’s evil as inertia, evil as the force that resists the creative movement of the Ring-Cosmos. There’s also positive evil, the actions of individual beings working along the same angle as the Ring-Chaos. This is much closer to the conventional notion of evil, but that’s not discussed in this chapter. Negative evil is far more basic, and so it comes up for discussion first.
Here as elsewhere, Fortune is trying to jolt the reader out of habitual ways of thinking—in this case, the common notion that of course we know exactly what good and evil are, that they’re whatever our cultural (or subcultural, or countercultural) presuppositions inspire us to love and hate respectively, and that we can get rid of evil (or we could, if only those bad people over there stopped being bad people, or simply stopped being). At the time this book was written, such notions were just as fashionable as they are now, and just as counterproductive.
At the heart of those fashionable confusions, then as now, is the assumption that good and evil are objective universal qualities of things: in a word, that they’re facts rather than values. Let’s take a moment to unpack that distinction. If I say, “it rained here in East Providence yesterday evening,” that is (or at least purports to be) a statement of fact, and if you were standing on the corner of James and Taunton a stone’s throw from my apartment on the evening in question, you would be able to tell whether it was actually a statement of fact or not.
Now let’s imagine that you have a garden and I have a hay meadow next to each other on the outskirts of East Providence on the evening in question. It’s shaping up to be a hot dry summer, and as the clouds begin to spit down rain, you look at your garden and say, “Oh, good, it’s raining.” At the same moment, I look at my hay meadow, knowing that rain will spoil the new mown hay, and say, “Oh, crap, it’s raining.”  For you, rain is good; for me, it’s evil.
That’s where we cross the boundary between a fact and a value. Where a statement of fact says something about the objective properties of a thing, a statement of value says something about the subjective relationship of an observer to that thing. Good and evil are values, not facts, because something can never simply be good or evil; it must always be good or evil to someone, good or evil for something, and so on.
Does that mean that good and evil are whatever you say they are? This is where Fortune’s analysis hits its stride. Good and evil, in her metaphor, are always relative to a cosmos; good is the plane in which the Ring-Cosmos forms, and evil is the plane in which the Ring-Chaos forms. A different cosmos will have its Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos in different planes, and so good and evil may mean something completely different there. Note, though, that from within a given cosmos, the original angles of its rings are absolutes. If you’re part of that cosmos, you can’t change them; all you can do is respond to them.
As we’ll see, furthermore, everything is a cosmos. Your garden and my hay meadow are cosmoi—yes, that’s the plural of cosmos—with their Rings at different angles, so that rain that evening is at the angle of your garden’s Ring-Cosmos and my hay meadow’s Ring-Chaos. Everything that exists has its own Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos, and Ring-Pass-Not: put another way, everything that exists is in a state of equilibrium between a set of forces that tend to sustain it and a set of forces that tend to dissolve it. At every scale of being, the same pattern repeats.
This is one of many places where The Cosmic Doctrine does a remarkable job of anticipating a body of knowledge that didn’t really come into being until after Dion Fortune’s death. Systems theory was a product of the decades following the Second World War; it was newborn when The Cosmic Doctrine was first privately published in 1949, and didn’t exist when Fortune penned the original manuscript in 1923 and 1924—and yet many of the core concepts in our text are also core concepts of systems theory. Did Fortune read some of the first tentative writings that laid the foundations of systems theory, such as Jan Smuts’ Holism and Evolution? Or was Charles Fort right to argue that human creativity is subject to something like seasonal cycles, so that ideas crop up in various minds when it’s time for them to appear? It’s an interesting question.
One way or another, we can make good sense of Fortune’s discussion of good and evil if we take the word “cosmos” and replace it with the word “system.” What is a system? There are various definitions in systems theory, but the most useful here is that a system is a set of self-sustaining interactions among a definable group of things. Quite a bit of systems theory talks about the way that systems find an equilbrium between anabolic processes (those that move toward complexity and integration, i.e., the Ring-Cosmos) and catabolic processes (those that move toward simplicity and disintegration, i.e., the Ring-Chaos), but I want to focus on a different point here.
Systems unite into greater systems and subdivide into smaller systems. From the viewpoint of systems theory, you are a system; you are made up of systems (your nervous system, your digestive system, etc.) which are made up of systems called tissues, which are made up of systems called cells, and so on. Going the other direction, you are part of a system called a community, which is part of a system called a nation, which is part of a system called humanity, and so on. Each of those systems, in Fortune’s terms, is a cosmos with its own set of rings.
So those labels “good” and “evil” can be applied to a great many rings going at a great many angles. You are part of some of those systems, and how much influence you have over them varies dramatically from case to case. Some of those systems, of course, are also part of you, and your digestive system (for example) may well have its own ideas about what is good and what is evil!  Then there are other systems that are distinct from you, and exist independently in one of the larger systems to which you already belong. Each of these are cosmoi. Each has its own good and evil, just as you have, and your interactions with all of these nested systems defines your life.
Good and evil in the usual moral sense of the words are simply the Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos of the culture (or subculture, or counterculture) in which you happen to have been born, or in which you now live. Notice how this works: if you do the things your culture (etc.) considers good, you will end up more deeply integrated into it; if you do the things your culture (etc.) considers evil, you will probably end up either removing yourself from it or being removed from it—in either case, you’re following the the Ring-Chaos, which is a suction toward outer space.
If you’ve had the experience of leaving one subculture and ending up in another, as so many people do these days, you know what it’s like to drift quickly or slowly out of line with the rest of the subculture, to spiral out to the edge of the Ring-Pass-Not, and then one day to find that you’re on the outside looking in and nothing inside really makes sense to you any more. Take Fortune’s metaphors and apply them to that experience, and the abstract structure of Rings and angles may be a little less abstract thereafter.
Let’s move on.  In the last page and a half or so of the chapter we’re studying, Fortune takes her analysis of evil and builds on it in a way that many people find counterintuitive, even threatening. She suggests that there are basically two ways of dealing with negative evil: you can oppose it in order to lock it into place and make it permanent, and then do something with that; or you can draw back from it in order to let it follow its natural trajectory to the Ring-Pass-Not, where it will dissolve back into raw substance and go away.
We don’t think like this in modern Western cultures. Our basic assumption is that if you want any kind of evil to go away, you fight it and destroy it, and if you want it to stick around, you back away from it and let it follow its trajectory. That’s deeply ingrained into our thinking, and probably explains why we’re so bad at dealing with evil.
Evil in the terms we’re using, remember, doesn’t mean whatever you happen to hate. Negative evil, which is what we’re discussing, is the circle of force at right angles to the current of evolution, the suction toward dissolution and the Void. There are certainly things you and I don’t like that can’t be met with the strategies Fortune offers, but then they’re not what she’s talking about when she speaks of negative evil.
I’d like to ask everyone who’s participating in this online study group to read the paragraph above at least three times, and make an effort to remember it. I’ve noticed that in studying The Cosmic Doctrine, this is one of the places where brain cramps hit the largest number of people. They read the concept I’ve just reviewed, they seem to understand it, and then five seconds later they start going on about the Nazis this and the Nazis that and the Nazis couldn’t have been stopped by letting them follow their trajectory to the Ring-Pass-Not blah blah blah. (Yes, it’s almost always the Nazis that come up here—an interesting testimony to Adolf Hitler’s effectiveness in getting his ideas permanently glued into people’s heads.)
Anyone who does this in the discussion that follows this week’s post will have the content of their comment erased and replaced by the following: (Didn’t pay attention and started babbling about Nazis.)  We’re not talking about Nazism, or any of the concrete historical manifestations of positive evil. We’re talking about negative evil, the cosmic principle of disintegration and devolution, in terms of a set of abstract symbols; the practical applications of those symbols, and the discussion of positive evil, will follow in due time. As it happens, Dion Fortune took on the Nazis in magical combat, and won; what’s more, she did it using the exact strategy she laid out in the chapter you’re reading. (We’ll discuss that in due time, too.)
Now in principle you can do the same two things Fortune describes when you have to deal with positive evil, i.e., with persons or forces within a cosmos that are moving in harmony with the Ring-Chaos of that cosmos. You can use them as a thrust block, something to push against so that you have traction for something you want to do. Alternatively, you can evade them, and let them follow their own trajectory right out to the void. Both of those work, though they work in different ways. Both of them also require skill and a good sense of timing.
Interestingly, this is something that martial artists know. If you’re a competent martial artist and somebody throws a punch at you, broadly speaking, you can do one of two things. You can block the punch, and use that moment of hard contact between your bodies as a basis for your own response. Alternatively, you can evade the punch so that the other guy wastes his energy in empty air. Different martial arts (and different martial artists) specialize in one or the other of these, and take it in various directions; a karateka, say, may use a block so forceful it damages the other guy’s arm and then kick him in the face while the pain has him off balance; an aikidoka may slip neatly out of the way of the punch and then add a graceful push at exactly the wrong moment, so that the other guy loses his balance and meets the ground face first. Either way, though, the principle is there.
Either way, too, you’re using evil for your own purposes. That doesn’t mean that you move in harmony with it, in the plane of the Ring-Chaos; that’s what Fortune has in mind when she warns about working dynamically with evil. Instead you use evil as a static presence, either to propel yourself along the track of the Ring-Cosmos, or to take something out of existence for you. That’s one of the secrets of the initiates: since negative evil is always present, you might as well do things with it, and this is how you do things with it without getting caught up in it.
It helps, by the way, if you make sure that you’re actually moving in the same plane as the Ring-Cosmos of your system. Few things are so common in human life as a person or a group of people who are so sure they’re on the side of the angels that they never bother to check, and it’s quite possible for two parties in bitterest contention with each other—at right angles to each other, in Fortune’s symbolism—to be equally far from the Ring-Cosmos. That’s common in situations when a conflict remains stuck in place for a long time; since they’re equally balanced between the two primary Rings, neither side wins and neither side dissolves. Their opposition remains as solid as concrete.
You oppose something when you want to lock it into place in order to build on it; as some schools of psychology like to point out, “what you resist, persists.” You evade something when you want to send it spinning out past your Ring-Pass-Not. Choose carefully which of these you want to do, because the results will not be the same.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you do this, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on August 8. Until then, have at it!

If I may make an interesting observation here: peak oil seems like an example of a negative evil. And we had two responses to it: double down on what made it a problem (resist it), or change to a sustainable lifestyle (get out of the way).
I suppose this also means Green Wizardry is a way to get out of the way of that negative evil.
This seems odd to think about to me, since the world that progress threatens to make it there were no limits on it seems even worse than the fall of civilization!

John–
I’ll be spending (considerable) time with this material, but some initial thoughts:
First, this schema of negative evil as one aspect of building-up/tearing-down, growth/decay, and similar rhythmic processes puts the issue I spoke of earlier this week re Geburah, the interplay of the Pillars of Force and Form, and your point of, shall we say, the “necessity of Ares” in a completely different light.  This makes sense to me and is a good deal less threatening.
Second, I hadn’t made the leap to considering the model proposed as relative (versus absolute) to different things — i.e., there being a multitude of cosmoi.  I’d fallen into the trap (for lack of a better term) of seeing this as a single, grand universal construct.  Again, now it all suddenly makes much more sense.  (And as a math nerd, I can totally relate to systems theory analogies!)
Third, I’d thought of the Ring-Pass-Not as an absolute barrier rather than a relative one.  It isn’t that one can’t pass the Ring-Pass-Not; rather, one cannot pass the Ring-Pass-Not and remain part of the cosmos in question.  (Cue clouds parting and angelic choir-voices swelling.)
Am I on track here?
The mind-training is seriously beginning now.  Back to the text.

Will, that’s why the concept of negative evil needs to be approached as an abstraction first. Nothing in the universe of our experience is simple enough to correspond exactly to the three rings; at most, you can find things that more or less have some characteristics in common with one or another of those very basic concepts. The world as we experience it is too complex to provide anything else. Here’s my question for you: if you resist peak oil, what are you locking into place and what can you build on that? 
As for your second comment, I gave fair warning… (whistles while walking away)  😉
David, excellent. The Ring-Pass-Not is absolute on the highest scale, but you and I and the rest of humanity don’t deal with that scale very often. In the microcosms generated within the Cosmos as a whole, things are a bit more permeable.







 David, by the lake says:

John–
Is there any correlation between the triad of Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos, and Ring-Pass-Not on one hand, and the triad of Form, Force, and Consciousness in the Tree of Life on another hand, and the triad of elements of Calas, Gwyar, and Nwyfre on a third (?) hand?

As I mentioned on the dreamwidth account a little while back I was recently under what I understood to be magical attack, and took measures to help with that.  I began washing my floors with herbs, burning cedar, frankincense, angelica and sage, and bathing in protective herbs as well.  Doing this actions helped me greatly with the attack, but after the forceful negativity seemed to subside, I still continue to do all the same things them because they’ve made my life significantly better. 
If I consider the attack to be part of the negative evil of inertia of leaving a subculture, then I can see how by counteracting it, gently as I could,  I was forced to create something in my life better than was before.  My vibe has improved greatly because of this experience, my room is cleaner and my relationship with my family has become significantly more harmonious.  So I may have used the negative forces as a thrusting block towards a higher plane, as Fortune discusses in the text.  For this reason I am grateful for the experiences, whatever their provenance, as they forced me to become a better person than I was before.  Without friction there can be no wilful, directed movement.  Friction, or negative evil, then is what allows for choice.  Evil is what creates the opportunity towards self-betterment.

David, sounds like an excellent theme for a week or so of daily meditations! 😉
Violet, got it in one. This is also one of the reasons why daily banishing rituals are so useful.
Yorkshire (offlist), if you want to delete the snotty personal jab and resubmit your comment, I’ll put it through.

@ JMG, thanks for your response!  Thinking about the Western approach to evil reminds me forcefully of the concluding paragraph of Carl Jung’s Red Book, where he discusses the double bind of evil as it is understood in the Biblical context.  You’ve mentioned before that he and Dion Fortune could have switched places, with her the depth psychologist and him the mage. Well, I think that this offers some corroborating evidence, and is to my mind very much relevant to the current discussion:
“Therefore he who strives for the highest finds the deepest.
…he who accepts what approaches him because it is also in him, quarrels and wrangles no more, but looks into himself and keeps silent. 
He sees the tree of life, whose roots reach into Hell and whose top touches Heaven. He also no longer knows differences: who is right? What is holy? What is genuine? What is good? What is correct? He knows only one difference: the difference between below and above. For he sees that the tree of life grows from below to above, and that it has its crown at the top, clearly differentiated from the roots. To him this is unquestionable. Hence he knows the way to salvation.
To unlearn all distinctions save that concerning direction is part of your salvation. Hence you free yourself from the old curse of the knowledge of good and evil. Because you separated good from evil according to your best appraisal and aspired only to the good and denied the evil that you committed nevertheless and failed to accept, your roots no longer suckled the dark nourishment of the depths and your tree became sick and withered.
Therefore the ancients said that after Adam had eaten the apple, the tree of paradise withered. Your life needs the dark. But if you know that it is evil, you can no longer accept it and you suffer anguish and you do not know why: Nor can you accept it as evil, else your good will reject you. Nor can you deny it since you know good and evil. Because of this the knowledge of good and evil was an insurmountable curse.
But if you return to primal chaos and if you feel and recognize that which hangs stretched between the two unbearable poles of fire, you will notice that you can no longer separate good and evil conclusively, neither through feeling nor through knowledge, but that you can discern the direction of growth only from below to above. You thus forget the distinction between good and evil, and you no longer know it as long as your tree grows from below to above. But as soon as growth stops, what was united in growth falls apart and once more you recognize good and evil.”

I’m going to try to use Fortune’s metaphors using examples from your other writings to see if I understand. Catabolic Collapse is a negative evil as it’s a disintegrating force in our (current) civilization cosmos. On that cosmological scale, there are two ways to handle it. 
One is to “collapse early and avoid the rush” and adopt to a more energy restricted world preemptively. This would be the response of “opposing it and locking it in place” since it would make the collapse in some sense permanent. There’s a lot that can be built on the more resilient base. The other is to let it run its course as it’ll ultimately pass on. With catabolic collaspe, it may or may break apart the particular cosmos in the process since it hasn’t been handled well either way. On a more personal cosmos level, there’s a similar situation and similar choices and you can execute them well or poorly.

Suddenly my inner life of values and how they have changed is feeling like a study in orbital mechanics! I felt powerless as the negative evil within me pulled me away from the Ring-Comsos of a subculture I just wasn’t cut out for. For a time I tried to oppose it, but it just wouldn’t budge. Since then I let it go (somewhat) and believe I have nearly reached the Ring-Pass-Not of that subculture. However I don’t think i have quite left that cosmos entirely. Am i applying these concepts correctly? This is my first foray into this kind of esoteric thinking.

The discussion of Fortune’s two strategies prompted me to think of three topics that touch the edges of science fiction: orbital mechanics, Orson Scott Card’s political advocacy, and Area 51.
In orbital mechanics, there’s a counter-intuitive tendency that slower objects complete their orbit more quickly, and become more central to the system in which they orbit. The Integral Trees, by Larry Niven, includes a saying for children to remember this dynamic: “East takes you out, out takes you west, west takes you in, in takes you east; north and south bring you back”. Anathem, by Neal Stephenson, also has a careful treatment of the topic, where a character struggles against his intuition of how motion should work. In any event, it sounds like orbits in deep space are also a good model for this same reason: trying to stop something centers it, and may even cause a spectacular impact.
Secondly, Orson Scott Card wrote a famous (in LGBTQ activist circles, infamous) letter in favor of California’s Proposition 8, framing his opposition to same-sex marriage as the logical result of his belief that each person has a reproductive obligation to all their ancestors. He wrote that The State shouldn’t support any dereliction of this procreative duty. I’m usually impressed by the expansive sweep of time he imagines in his writing, and the understanding he displays of long-term tides of population change; this letter surprised me by being exactly what I wouldn’t expect from him. Governments, and especially the laws they construct, are extremely short-lived compared to genes; if I felt my descendants had a duty to breed as abundantly as humanly possible, I wouldn’t trust laws to enforce any behavior that contradicts instinct. It seems prudent not to force this generation to pass along any genetic proclivity that prevents reproduction (within Card’s cosmos, according to my reading of his letter, a passive evil); resisting homosexuality in the way Card advocates, seems likely to establish it more firmly. I had interpreted this as an uncharacteristic oversight on his part, but now I wonder whether it was an effort to maintain traction.
Thirdly, I am amazed to think how much traction was achieved in the effort to keep secrets about military aircraft, with just a few official efforts to quash any discussion of space aliens.
I look forward to re-reading the assigned passage with this in mind, and I look forward to learning more about that historic combat.

I had a similar experience to Violet’s at one of the hostels I was staying in. There were two born agains in the hostel, and I was out about my own religion, and engaged them angrily when they said nature spirits were evil. Specifically, he was talking about elves. Boy it burns me up when christians talk about any other possible spirit outside of their own pantheon as being evil! Anyways, they started following me around and speaking in tongues at me. It was disturbing. 
However, this was the moment on the blog where I started getting serious about developing a banishing ritual that would reflect my own beliefs. And now I use it all the time and I will do so until the day I die. So I think this is a good example of pushing against.

This is the first time I have been able to follow the reading and I find it very interesting.  this notion, that if you resist something you make it persist, I have heard before, and have been contemplating it a lot in the last few years.  Right now I am in the process of calling into question all the beliefs that I have had, and I feel pretty isolated from friends and family, who seems to be repeating the same slogans over and over.  But I feel really lost too.  this reading has come at a very  appropriate time for me.  Also your book, “Mystery Teachings from the Living Earth”.  Thanks. Kathy







 Varun says:

Archdruid,
Okay, I’ve definitely experienced the first form of resisting evil and using it to build something better. My anger against an exfriend was so intense that it propelled me to change my whole life style. I met the anger with a drive to accomplish, and changed the very core of me for the better. So old me was the ring cosmos, the conflict with the friend was ring chaos, and the new self is the cycling of the ring cosmos into the ring pass not. 
Similarly, the martial arts I’m take is southern mantis which uses a similar offense/defense style to karate. We call it bridge hands, and slamming into someone else’s bridge is called crashing the bridge. 
I still can’t figure out what is meant by “you must hate the hate with sufficient force to lock it up…”
Regards,
Varun

John and everyone
I’m putting this as a separate comment so John can set it aside if he deems it too off-topic for this post.  (I can resubmit during the next open post, if need be.)
But between Will’s comment re Greenwizardy (which called to mind his journal project), John’s response to my last post here, Violet’s comment above, and a couple of other haphazard incidents here on my end, I had the craziest notion pop into my head:
A scholarly (peer-reviewed?) journal of meditative and experimental magic.
On-line?  Print?  I have no idea.  Quarterly?  Semi-annual? Annual?
But a journal where folks would submit scholarly articles regarding of meditations on themes, results of controlled magical experiments, workings with correlations, and other practical magic.  All of which could then be subject to further examination and experimentation by other researchers 🙂 in follow-on replications and those results reported in further articles.  (You know, all the things that scientific research used to be back in the day.)
Reactions?  Thoughts?  (Suggestions for a title?)







 John Michael Greer says:

Violet, to my mind the Red Book, or the extract from it titled Seven Sermons to the Dead, would have made a fine launching point for a magical system. It really is a pity that Jung and Hermann Hesse didn’t found the Ordo Peregrini Orientem! 
Chris, that’s one way to assign the labels. What about attempting to stop the collapse from happening? How would that lock it into place? 
Mitch, so far, so good. 
Yorkshire, it’s already been deleted. I don’t edit people’s posts for them, so you’ll have to resubmit if you want your announcement to appear. 
Joel, fascinating. I don’t know a great deal about orbital mechanics, but what you’ve said makes sense, and you’re certainly right about Area 51! Card’s essay always struck me as one of the classic examples of preaching to the choir, since the only people who would be impressed by his logic were those who shared his Mormon religious beliefs, and trying to tell the rest of the world “you should obey my religious doctrines even though you don’t believe in them” is a very effective way to lose. You may be right that he wanted to keep same-sex relationships around in order to have something to push back against…
Aron, and of course they also used you to push against, so that they could make their own religious commitment stronger. So you did them a favor! 
Katherine, that’s a challenging thing to go through, no question. Try to get comfortable with the feeling of being lost, though — it’ll make it less of a challenge for you to release other assumptions and fixed beliefs in the future. 
Varun, good. If somebody hates you, and you want to fix that in place in order to build something on top of it, push back; flaunt the thing they hate, fling it in their face, and get them fixated on hating you. Then, having locked them into a rigid posture, go do something else. Donald Trump does this all the time; watch the way he uses tweets to get his opponents into a screaming frenzy of hate, and then while they’re so busy hating him they don’t have time to pay attention to anything else, he pushes through some other policy on some unrelated subject, and it goes through unopposed. I have no reason to think the guy’s read the Cos. Doc., but he’s got that particular gimmick down to a fine art. 
David, I have no idea if there would be a market for that or not, but it might well be worth looking into.

Unobstructed negative evil generates diffusive flows. Complete effective opposition to negative evil creates stasis and pressure. Aka potential energy. Restraining negative evil incompletely can create channeled flows.

So maybe I should get out of the way of   the positive evil (?) of unchecked banks, corporations, billionaires and eternal warmongers, and let the negative evil (?) of the mindless mob undo the market-based dissolution and devolution of the biosphere, to be the end of the Aeon of Pisces and the beginning of the Aeon of the Waterbearer??

Perhaps it is a pagination problem. Each pdf page is pretty huge.
About the movement of the rings. I seem to envision the pass-not as not being a ring but more of a disk, and while the cosmos and chaos are spinning like hoops, the pass-not goes ed over end so as to create a full globe. Is that OK?

Wow.  The Christian contingent of this world’s brothers’-keepers would have a real hard time with this concept, because it agrees so well with what is taught in the Bible:  evil only exists because God created it.
Do forgive my naivety, John – but what do the Nazis have to do with any of this?







 Will J says: 



								July 11, 2018 at 9:24 pm							




Yeah, I deserved that. 😉
Resisting peak oil would mean doubling down on industrial society as the limits to it are in your face. This locks in place resource issues, and as for what to build on it, I’m not sure yet. For those with economies less dependent on cheap oil, I can see how they’re building on it, but that may be them getting of the way instead. I think it may be a theme for meditation, since I think there’s more there.
Allow me to try again, without babbling about Nazis 😉 Let’s use the American Empire as an example. Would the forces pulling that empire into the compost heap of history count as negative evil? They are pulling in the direction of dissolution of a political system that currently dominates much of the world, so I suppose they would. This is not a good thing from the point of view of most Americans, or even most Canadians.
Resisting them locks in place a far more destructive future, since those pressures are still there, while getting out of the way, dropping the empire, would let them pass harmlessly. Once locked in place, rival imperial powers can build on it to tear the empire down faster and build their own.
This would seem to suggest that it may not always be the person/force that locked the negative evil in place that can build on the forces now locked in play, although I don’t know where to take that line of thinking at this point.

Two comments: first, why is simplicity linked with disintegration and complexity with integration?  This linkage seems pretty arbitrary to me.  Second is something that initially gave me trouble but maybe I’ve resolved it; in the next to last paragraph on p. 16 she writes, “It [“evil”], therefore passes out to the periphery of the universe till it meets the spin of the Ring-Pass-Not…,”  I was thinking that this “evil” was situated in the Ring-Chaos, which would imply a second Ring-Pass-Not outside it.  But after several readings, I think she’s saying that the “evil” is situated inside the Ring-Cosmos.  At least that’s how I’ve resolved.  Am I being too literal-minded here?

How do we know if we are the evil headed to the void? 
I mentioned last week I destroyed my modern laptop in favor of this older one. What allowed me to summon the courage to do that was that I’ve found myself on a very different spiritual plane the past three weeks, rather it was the plane I was already in but all of a sudden it makes sense. And through that –  A matter of geomancy I’ve been pondering for two years has yielded some very pround self-knowledge and also taught me something about where I grew up. 
I feel from an occult view point/spiritual persepctive I’m entering a very dangerous period of awakening. I keep telling myself if I conduct myself with honor and integrity what have I to fear. But suppose I should know better it’s not as simple as that.

Hello JMG and all.
	This may seem tangential, and I hope you can bear with me: When you discussed the negative evil of the Ring Chaos, I immediately thought of Homer’s Odyssey, particularly of Poseidon’s role in impeding Odysseus’s return home. I imagined Poseidon as a specific embodiment of this negative evil, and that the Ring Chaos might be a helpful concept in formulating an approach to his obstructionism. Before I get carried away, do you think this is a valid understanding, or am I just out in the weeds?

Onething, your edition has big pages! The reading for last month was the first half of chapter 1 of the Millennium edition; for this month, the second half, beginning with the paragraph that starts “Now that movement in the Ring-Cosmos, spinning in one plane…”
Walt, ding! We have a winner. Entropy is a very common expression of that principle Fortune calls negative evil. 
William, as I said, we’ll get into practical applications a good deal further on. For now, try to make sense of the concepts. 
Onething, the Ring-Pass-Not is a sphere, not a disk — it’s formed by the Ring-Cosmos going end over end, as shown in the illustration. 
Pat, thank you. The Cos. Doc. is very solid stuff. I hope you have the book on order, or at least have been able to download one of the many free PDF copies available online! 
Steve, oh, it’s worse than that. As Lao Tsu pointed out, good can’t exist without evil, and evil can’t exist without good, because the two concepts only have meaning in contrast with each other. As for the Nazis, good question, but when I mention word “evil” people drag them in. 
Will, good. Let’s take the British empire as an example. Britain had the immense good sense in 1945 to let her empire go spinning off along the plane of the Ring-Chaos, where it dissolved. As a result, she didn’t lock decline in place. Plenty of other empires fought their decline tooth and nail, and locked it in place; they then spent centuries dealing with constant decline, often in its bitterest forms, until finally they lost the capacity to fight…and then the decline ended and rebuilding could begin. 
John, integration in systems theory terms means interconnection and interaction between different elements of a system, so it’s a kind of complexity — arguably the most important kind. Disintegration is simplification. Consider the difference between a building, and the heap of rubble left when the building is blown to smithereens. The building is complex and integrated; the pile of rubble has disintegrated, and it’s also simple — it’s just a heap of rubble, connected and related only by the force of gravity. 
As for evil, you’re confusing two different uses of the word. The Ring-Chaos is the Prime Evil of the system; things within the Ring-Pass-Not that move in the same plane as the Ring-Chaos, in harmony with the Prime Evil, are individual evils and evil things. 
Aron, exactly. You used each other as a thrust block! 
Austin, no, it actually is as simple as that. Stick to your ethics and you’ll be fine.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								July 11, 2018 at 10:54 pm							




Bird, depends on what you mean by wickedness. Negative evil is evil as friction, limitation, resistance; it’s passive. Positive evil is active. 
Lunar Apprentice, not a bad metaphor for the metaphor! Yes, you can see all the obstacles that kept Odysseus from Ithaca as forms of negative evil.

Hello JMG and all,
That changing of subcultures experience, yes! – looking at it in terms of two of the POVs (the individual moving towards dis-association with the group, and that of the group collectively) in relation to cosmos and negative evil illustrates the dynamic of the process so well. 
This section made me consider a whole flood of situations from childhood to the present- when have I acted as the negative evil element? And with intent, as positive evil? When have I acted as a cosmos or as part of a cosmos, in either directly opposing or excising what I perceived as negative evil? When have I encountered positive evil and how did I deal with that? What element was I in the eyes of the “other’s” POV?  
What things happened inside the cosmos that caused me or another to move towards the ring-pass-not and eventual cessation of existence within cosmos?  What shifted in the economy of that cosmos- in terms of exchange and flow, what contracts did I make that were broken (whether by me or by others) and what assumed expectations simply did not match the reality of the relationships? What relationships were strengthened by an increased harmony within the cosmos once the boundaries and values were determined? And what inner realizations were the seeds of those actions?
So many questions! I already have my memories, feelings, and opinions about what happened in all those many situations, but analyzing it in these terms sheds new light on the forces at play, and provides insight for the future. And hopefully more fully-conscious choice of actions.
The reading and the discussions show me a new ways of looking at it makes it seem like all the awfulness of the painful situations was good for something, after all. 
I really feel like I’m getting a first-rate education in occult theory here.
Thank you everyone!
Bonnie

Two notes: firstly, since last month’s reading of Chapter 1, I’ve been reading other books much more slowly than I used to. This has given me more insight into the pop-science book I’m currently reading (mostly about the assumptions and genre conventions of pop-science books). Thanks to you and Dion Fortune for that.
Secondly, it’s a great relief to hear that direct confrontation isn’t always the best way to deal with disruptive influences. I’ve got a few contentious souls in my local community group which I have been reluctant to outright fight because I suspect they’d be better at it than me. It’s helpful to know that that isn’t just weakness on my part.

Greetings all,
(1) It seems to me that the 3 rings have a fractal nature as they are found at all scales from the grandest to the smallest.
(2) I am currently studying the Kybalion. Is it valid to say that the ALL (the unmanifest) has imagined / dreamed the grandest of the grandest of all 3 rings that bound all subsequent 3 rings systems that fractal their way down to the smallest of the smallest of all 3 ring systems? And somehow we find ourselves somehow tangled up into a net of 3 ring systems?

Oh, goodness, then I am a bit ahead. Well, immediately I see that I don’t understand this:
“spinning in one plane and rotating while it spins as if upon an axis, ”
because to me spinning and rotating on an axis are the same thing. I am having a hard time with the descriptions, not really knowing which thing she is referring to. I wish there could be a model in a video. I don’t know whether the thing is difficult to envision or not, but trying to follow words about it is really tough.

@Onething
The revised edition split chapter 1 from the original edition in two and added three paragraphs on the front. I did a line-by-line comparison a while ago. The material is substantially the same, but I seem to remember a couple of substantive differences. It’s just in different chapters.
I noticed a few people getting confused last month by going past the assigned part of chapter 1 in the original (Millennium) edition. The fact that at least one of the pdfs makes each chapter a wall of text without paragraph breaks doesn’t help.

Just thinking of what one could build on declining resources and growing pollution, if one does as our societies seem to be doing and locks it in place by doing more of the same. One thing some people are trying to do is to produce technological fixes to the various aspects of our predicament, so maybe that’s what they’re building on it.
Collapsing now to avoid the rush seems more like evading being smashed by the catabolic processes involved.
I’m not really used to thinking in terms of occult philosophy. If I think of Dion’s ‘negative evil’ as entropy, the whole thing makes sense, whereas evil already has a meaning that doesn’t fit how negative evil is being used here.

I have a 60×120′ lot with a one bedroom house in Minneapolis. There are 30 fruit trees, 200 species of plants, most wild, some edible, some medicinal. 
Every year the first week of July, when the lot reaches peak rainforest/jungle-like, I receive three citations from the city. I could probably avoid it, but I tend to let nature do what it will do, after planting the veggie gardens and early weeding. I have been doing necessary garden work all week. It has felt very good. There are nine types of fruit ripe right now.
Some of my neighbors see this garden like there is something evil about. I’d guess the city gets 100 calls a year. They might get 100 calls from people who think what I have here is good, but  the city only logs complaints.
I see this garden as a kind of perfect order, though it would be described by most as chaos. I see it as a kind of antidote to the chaos of society, the madness of the Left and Right in eternal perpetuating combat, becoming increasingly deranged.
Meanwhile in the midst of the chaos of society, I find my life ever more ordered, ever more syncronicitous, myself ever more grounded, productive and creative.
Ever aware of the “good” and “evil”, order and chaos, within me. Ever appreciative of your work. Thanks.

Bonnie, excellent. Yes, it does sound as though you’re getting it. 🙂
Kfish, delighted to hear it. Reading slowly is practically a lost art at this point, but it’s worth reviving. As for avoiding confrontation, it often takes more courage to walk away from a fight than to engage in one…
Karim, yes to both questions. Good! 
Onething, if you’ll look at the diagram toward the beginning of the post, and imagine the white ring turning as shown by the dotted lines, that might help.
Pygmycory, entropy is one manifestation of negative evil, so you’re not wrong. 
Onething, dead on target. Yes, exactly. 
Pygmycory, I wouldn’t have used the term “negative evil” if I was writing this from scratch, but it’s Dion Fortune’s book so we’re kind of stuck with her terminology. If it helps you to think of it as entropy, go with that. 
William, it’s a classic conflict between two different conceptions of order — the order of nature, which your garden is expressing, and the order of a particular human culture, which  the city government is trying to enforce. The order of nature always wins in the long run, if that’s any consolation!

Perhaps a bit “Meta” but if you’re aware of your intentions how can you really be sure that in your attempt to draw back from something to allow it “follow its trajectory” your not just cementing it into place?  Perhaps I shouldn’t be cross reading Jung, but it did make consider how this relates to unwanted impulses don’t really go away but get hidden from the conscious by incorporating them into the unconscious shadow.  Hard won wisdom from Violet’s repression of sexual desire and vegetarianism? (I doubt Wikipedia is any more fair to the deceased than it is with the living so thats cheap speculation) 
This is a bit trip because it implies that mastery over your own “will” can’t be bootstrapped with the common notion of will or forced discipline, you’re astral “will” has to be won over gently with acceptance that may only be obtainable in the surrender / death of conscious.  A trite and oft repeated occult notion; but the syncreticity with mystical wisdom seems to add to the legitimacy of model’s symbolism. Surrender the microcosmic will over to the macroscopic? Not something I ever saw in a new age witchcraft paperback.

SpiceIsNice, got it in one. Notice how the soi-disant “Resistance” is purely reactive — they’ve basically stopped trying to do anything but stop Trump. They have become his Ring-Chaos, the thrust block from which he gains traction. 
RedRed, that’s why I don’t get my magical philosophy out of new age witchcraft paperbacks. Your broader point — that it’s difficult to be sure you’re using the principles we’re discussing effectively in practice — is of course also an issue, but a different one.

If a person is tired, the person’s waking state is the Ring Cosmos and their negative evil is the forces of sleep.  Sleep of course is neither good nor bad.  If they try to actively battle being tired with a strong cup of coffee or some nasty energy drink, they end up prolonging and worsening insomnia (yes, I speak from personal experience).  If they skip the caffeine and give in and take a nap or go to bed, they give the Ring Chaos what it was headed for and dissolve into sleep, vanquishing tiredness/negative evil the next day.  
In other words, good night.

								July 12, 2018 at 5:18 am							




The discussion about the second response to negative evil – step back and allow it to dissipate/move past – reminds me of my favorite Ursula LeGuin passage in _Left Hand of Darkness_. The narrator explains (paraphrasing), All roads lead to [Rome]. Even if you’re traveling away from Rome, you’re still on that road. The only way to get off that road is to find a different destination.
It’s an evocatively written way of expressing that what you resist, you cause to persist.
I also can’t help but think this effect is part of the truth behind warnings to be careful about negative or destructive magical workings. It would be easy, especially at first, to accomplish the opposite of what one intended and cause the subject to persist. 
In contrast, a simple banishing or protective ward could have the aikido effect and allow the unwanted force/person/situation to slip past the Ring Pass-Not and out of one’s personal cosmos.
Here’s a question, though: a cosmos or system must maintain a dynamic balance between forces in order for the cosmos to persist. You suggested we examine whether we are aligned with (any given) Ring-Cosmos or with the Ring-Chaos. But the force toward simplification is merely a force, and – just as death is necessary for life to persist – the Ring-Chaos must sometimes be necessary or even preferred.
How would one know? How could a person step outside his/her own preferences to truly judge whether expansion or contraction needs more energy or focus at any given time?

By strange coincidence , Jasun Horsley has begun discussing the problem of evil over at auticulture.com, by way of descrbing Simone Weils “Gravity and Grace” which also seems suggestive of the concepts we are discussing here.
In a further concidence, i have just finished reading, on JMGs reccomendation, Aurora by Kim Stanley Robinson.
Sending Starships with artificial biomes out into the cosmos to colonise seems like a yearning to explore the lmits of the ring pass not, or even active evil , while staying at home and learning to love and live with limits would seem more Graceful to me .

JMG, you wrote in regards to conflict between two people: “…That’s common in situations when a conflict remains stuck in place for a long time; since they’re equally balanced between the two primary Rings, neither side wins and neither side dissolves. Their opposition remains as solid as concrete.” So my question is- might there be times when this analysis applies to inner conflict? If so, how might one discern such, and use it to advantage?

Hello, I am musing on the words “stable” vs “stability.”  Chapter one says: “IT [the unmanifest] alone is stable”.  Chapter two says: “the second movement, in opposition to the first, produced stability. It is always the function of opposition to produce stability”.   
The unmanifest alone is stable – perhaps this means something like moveless, historyless, unchanging.
Whereas our Ring-Cosmos is movement, and change, and acquires history as it moves and changes moment by moment.  So where is there a place to stand?  There isn’t one until opposition happens.  However, what it produces is “stability”, which, while not converting the manifest into anything truly stable, can dynamically produce a seeming of what stable might be like – ie “stability”, a seeming of movelessness, a seeming of historylessness, a seeming of unchangingness, which IS none of those things, but simply a seeming produced by two [momentarily, dynamically] opposed movements, opposed histories, opposed changes. 
Those are today’s jottings and musings.
Thank you.

Just as the ‘resistance’ is the thrust-block for Trump, so the Nazis were the thrust-block for decades of American exceptionalism (we saved the world, dontcha know). Stalin, Mao, Ho Chi Minh (whoops!) were not fit for purpose; no thrust-footing down those tunnels. The US military knew what it was about in self-promotion.
The military used these principles in a different way, as laid out in your UFO book, to defuse any inquiries into their secret-aircraft tests.
I also wonder if the end of the oil civilization is a kind of negative energy, one which will eventually alleviate problems like climate change, ocean plastic, etc (albeit at the expense of much suffering).

Thanks for the very approachable commentary on this chapter. This is what you maybe call practical and brings a flood of reflections. I concur that successful politicians excel at observing the opponents and either patiently deflect ( see Merkel) or throw them irresistible sticky bits ( US is too hyped-up now for subtle deflection).
Just few days ago actually I had a discussion( work related) where I tried to convince someone that waiting out and not taking any action may be the best strategy. They listened, nodded and said “BUT it couldn’t possibly work’ and repeated the usual tactic, which predictably failed, again. It was classic inertia-evil not purpose-evil, that could have been made useful.
So this is fun but I still have to go back all the time and work on the first chapter. I see all the planes, rotations, angles but it just doesn’t open a meaning beyond the picture like for some others here. Hopefully upcoming chapters can trigger that for me. This is my very first occult book. Even poetry tricks don’t seem to help.
Is this chapter the first lesson in the book how to shape the will?

Re: Ordo Peregrini Orientem
Ugh, it really is a pity.  I’ve reread the Red Book countless times, and few books have given me the numina per paragraph as it does.  Frankly, it is my favorite writing of Jung by a very wide margin.  
Re: Cosmic Doctrine
Something that this text makes me think of is politics, specifically the Burkean conservatism you support.  Since Burkean conservatism focuses on what has worked historically within the framework of a political institution and culture, it is operating squarely within the Ring-Cosmos of that system political/historical/cultural system.  It allows for greater complexity and integration over time, as Burke’s own support of religious liberty attest.  It resists negative evil by valuing both what has worked and by seeking to maintain cool-headed prudence as a safeguard against ordinary human stupidity and corruption. It resists positive evil by being wary of radical reform, like the French revolution, and being humble in regards to other political/historical/cultural institutions as well as the limits of human understanding in general. 
If I’m understanding this correctly, then the Cosmic Doctrine is exciting stuff indeed, it really does shed a lot of light on how things work out in the real world.   Indeed, it provides a template in which to visualize cosmoi and their various internal forces and to then interpret them using the language of Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos etc.  This is good training indeed!

I’ll admit that I only got started on the previous month’s exercises a few days ago.  I don’t have anything to say about this month’s reading because I don’t plan to do it until halfway through this monthly cycle, but I will comment on the Red Book.  I don’t think I can really derive much that is useful from it at this stage, but it is nonetheless fascinating – everything about it, including the fact that I spotted it in a used book store probably less than two months after I learned what it is – is, as Violet says, numinous.  I have the cheaper version without the colour plates, but the art is available online anyway.

One thing to keep in mind in this exercise is that the map is not the territory.  The model is not the work.  So using a limited metaphor in a limited mind has limits of understanding.  So the questions of “is this quite exactly that?” will have to stand as we attempt to connect understandings with the original author and their intent.
While this is true of all thinking, all works, it’s saying there may not be answers.  Maybe the author themselves fell short or were wrong in some way; we’re trying to know what they knew and think what they thought.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								July 12, 2018 at 3:06 pm							




Kimberly, good! I trust you slept well. 
Obsidian, the easiest way to do that is to let energies follow their own trajectory as often as possible, so that they can either add their force to the spinning of the Ring-Cosmos, or diffuse into nothingness with the Ring-Chaos. (This is what Lao Tsu talked about as wu-wei, “not-doing.”) Competent mages only intervene in the flow of events when they’re sure that a sequence of events is a temporary distortion in the flow. How do they figure that out? Divination backed up with a solid grasp of occult philosophy is the standard approach. 
Fabian, you’re mixing your metaphors, and they’re metaphors that have already been run through the blender too many times! In classic Tantra, where the terms come from, “right hand path” refers to the modes of practice that maintain traditional disciplines such as celibacy and avoidance of intoxicants, while “left hand path” refers to modes that occasionally and deliberately relax those prohibitions. Both use the thrust-block approach — the right hand path uses ordinary sensual desires as its thrust-block, while the left hand path uses the pride and self-righteousness of the ascetic as its thrust-block, and so both achieve their goals. 
As for space travel, I don’t think it’s accidental that Fortune specifically used the metaphor of heading for outer space as her core image of positive evil. Think through the logic of space travel in the context of where we are as a species: the resources that could be turned to fixing the mess we’ve made on this planet get turned instead to sending a very, very small fraction of humanity to another planet, while everyone else gets left with the mess. Pretty morally bankrupt, if you ask me…
Apprentice, in the case of internal conflict, since you yourself are holding the conflict in existence, you simply need to let go of one of the two contending forces, and follow the other. If you’re stuck between two options, choose one — at random, if necessary — and don’t look back. Alternatively, if you don’t want to make a decision, accept that refusal to decide as your thrust block: given that you’re not going to decide, find something else to do, and do it. 
Dr. Juliet Ashley, who was the third Grand Archdruid of AODA, had a thing her students used to call, laughing, the Ashley Technique. It consisted of two steps. The first was to identify your problem; the second was either to do something about it, or learn to live with it, take your pick — there’s no third option. I think of it as a practical application of the Cos. Doc.!
Scotlyn, good. That’s the distinction between stasis and dynamic balance. 
Expat, excellent! Yes, exactly. As for industrial civilization, I see what’s happening as an example of letting something follow its own dynamic out to dissolve against the Ring-Pass-Not. Nothing is stopping industrial civilization; it’s encountering no opposition that could fix it in place — and so it has become its own nemesis, and is spinning out toward the Void in its own proper time. 
Anne, take your time with the images. Some people have an easy time converting visual metaphors into practical applications, some find it much harder; with any luck the conversations here should help. As for the shaping of the will, indirectly, yes — Fortune realized that your will is guided by your basic assumptions about reality, and if you adjust those assumptions — even in subtle and roundabout ways — you change the way that the will works. 
Phil K, exactly. If you fixate on taking revenge in some more obvious form, you lock your enmity into place and waste energy you can use for other purposes. Use it as a thrust block to seek your own goals, such as living well, and you benefit. 
Violet, yes, exactly. Like any really good work of symbolic philosophy, the Cos. Doc. can be applied in astonishingly diverse ways. I’m pretty sure, though I’m still mulling over the details, that it can be used to understand healing; I’m quite sure that it makes an effective guide to military strategy, and that certain martial arts in particular match its approach to a remarkable degree. So, too, politics; we’ve talked already about the way that the current US administration uses some of its opponents as thrust blocks to pursue its own agenda, and allows others all the rope they need to hang themselves; the same principles can be applied more broadly, as you’ve suggested.

JMG- Does Fortune’s Ring-Chaos concept relate to the current reemergence of Kek, the Egyptian frog headed deity of chaos and rebirth? I find it almost hilarious to think of Alt-right guys chanting “praise Kek!” in front of their computer monitors. I would be interested in your thoughts on the subject.







 John Michael Greer says:

Justin, no question, it’s a remarkable book. Have you by any chance read Hermann Hesse’s novels — in particular, Steppenwolf and The Journey to the East? Hesse was a good friend of Jung’s, and there’s a lot of crossover between their work; jus for exampel, the Red Book to my mind is a fine instantiation of the “magic theater” of Steppenwolf.
Jasper, of course. Just don’t let that become an excuse not to understand the text when it challenges your presuppositions.
Danae, that’s one end of a huge issue. I really do need to talk about the Kek phenomenon, and the magical end of the Alt-Right generally, don’t I? I’ll consider a post on the subject.

In considering how to deal with negative evil, for some reason the first example that came to mind was that classic work of children’s occult literature, Bread and Jam for Frances.  In the story we find Frances the badger, at the dinner table, refusing to eat anything except, well, bread and jam.  Her mother, initiate as she must surely have been, chooses an interesting strategy to deal with this stubborn behavior which is in opposition to her Ring-Cosmos.  Rather than force Frances to sit at the table until midnight trying to get her to eat her healthy dinner, which would surely have gone poorly, she says, okay, you want bread and jam?  Have fun.  You can eat as much as you like.  So Frances goes on a bit of a bender and eats only bread and jam for three meals a day, plus snacks.  After a few days she is practically begging for a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, as her mother knew she would be.  Rather than oppose this strange obsession, she allows it to be for a time, steps out of the way, and thus causes it to run its course until it runs out of steam.  
At least, I hope that is an example of one of the strategies for dealing with negative evil.   The distinction between negative and positive evil is still fuzzy in my mind.  I’ll keep reading and meditating though.  Lots of ideas have been stirred up so far.

								July 12, 2018 at 4:21 pm							




Seems to me, that for those of us who understand evil to mean deliberate actions/inactions out of line with the will of God, that negative evil here might be read well as non-beneficial.  The rain on mown hay being non-beneficial, but on the garden beneficial.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								July 12, 2018 at 4:51 pm							




Stefania, that works! 
BoysMom, what you’re calling evil is one aspect of what Fortune calls “positive evil.” Her terms aren’t yours — which doesn’t mean that either of you is wrong. (Is the four-legged critter barking at you a dog, un chien, or ein Hund?) “Beneficial” and “non-beneficial” — how about “harmful” for this latter? — are good also, because they beg the same questions as “good” and “evil” — harmful to whom? Beneficial for what? — and that, which draws the line between facts and values, is a crucial point here.

If my interpretation is not mistaken then the Ring-Chaos is Entropy as seen in the perspective of System’s thought. In IT we often use both strategies, depending on the needs we have. We usually block entropy in our applications to make them last as much as possible, and we evade when we replace an obsolete application (thus letting it die “naturally”) when we replace it with a different application that was designed to deal with the previous app’s entropy source (and of course we know the new app will have new entropy paths).

Touching slightly on kimberly’s note above (re tiredness and sleep), a co-worker of mine showed me a bio-engineering article recently that was predicting the achievement of thousand-year human lifespans in the near future (meaning the capability, obviously, not the actual attainment…which would take, well, another thousand years).  My first thought was, “Who’d *want* to live that long?  Wouldn’t we get tired of seeing the same foolishness over and over again?”  But my second thought was the observation of our desperate attempt to push back against the natural forces of dissolution.  (We are, of course, going to achieve no such thing — but the energy, whether physical or psychic, consumed in the effort will still have consequences.)   The natural consequence of birth is death; concretion (Ring-Cosmos) and dispersion (Ring-Chaos) are components of the same process;  Chesed and Geburah each have their roles.
Understanding this (intellectually) is one thing.  Integrating it (emotionally) is something else completely.

When the discussion of the Cosmic Doctrine started I was working with the original edition, and tried to tackle the whole first chapter at once, which includes the discussion of evil. I found it impossible to understand, and even a little alarming. I was very grateful for the pdfs of the revised edition, which break the material up in a way that’s much easier to make use of. 
That said, I’ve been afraid to comment on this because I’m still not sure if I’m getting it.
The way to deal with evil is to either allow it to disperse of its own accord, or to use it as a thrust-block on which to build a greater good.
Good, in this context, is defined as that which allows a cosmos– I love the image of every system as a cosmos, which matches the way I naturally think about things– to move toward complexity and integration, while Evil is defined as that which pushes a cosmos toward simplicity and disintegration.
So, what does that mean? 
The thoughts that come to mind are these:
There was a time, I seem to remember, when leftwing protest movements were largely ignored both by the media and by their opposite numbers in the political scene. Certainly there were people who protested Bill Clinton’s bombing of Serbia in 1999, and who protested both the Republican and Democratic conventions in 2000, but very little was made of it and nobody really cared. In this kind of context the protest movement gains very little traction, and eventually dissolves of its own accord. Is this an example of “creating a vacuum around Evil, and allowing it to join the Ring-Chaos” in the context of whatever system-cosmos is being protested?
I then thought of the way that wars, and especially wars that can be portrayed as great defensive wars against an aggressor, can be used to unify nations. World War II uniting the country around Roosevelt and the cosmos of New Deal government gigantism, the Franco-Prussian War uniting Germany, and so on. Is this an example of an evil being to “lock up the forces of good by opposition, and so secure stability,” “a purchase on space?” Remembering that Good is that which allows a system to grow and integrate, I suppose this must be so.
Fortune tells us that this latter approach serves no useful purpose “unless you have a superabundance of good which shall stand upon the platform thus formed and leap up from it to greater heights.” What exactly does this mean? 
Hmm. Take the case of protest movements– and now I’m also thinking of the shrieking fixation on Islamic terror during the George Bush administration. Endlessly replaying images of Trump supporters being assaulted by masked Antifas serves the purpose of unifying Trump’s supporters and hardening their support. Of course, the Antifa crowd and the Left more generally does precisely the same thing in their own propaganda. Popping over to a popular Left-wing news site, I see that there are five stories on the front page. Every single one is about Trump. Three have pictures of Trump. One asks, “Will Kavanaugh Make Trump A Monarch?” Another: “Trump and Congressional Republicans Are Working to ‘End Welfare As We Know It.'” “American Democracy is In Peril — And It’s Not Because Of Bots [this underneath a picture of Donald Trump.]” The result, certainly, is the creation of a thrust-block for The Resistance(TM). 
Two days ago I visited a friend who, after almost five years of sobriety, went back to drinking upon the election of Donald Trump, and who now spends hours a day reading this sort of propaganda, flying into a blind rage, and drinking himself into a stupor. So, as you wrote in the example of the garden and the hayfield, Good doesn’t mean good for everything, nor Evil evil for everything. Good for systems of political mind control is pretty Evil for systems of individual human lives. 
How, then, would you oppose this sort of Evil– that is, Evil from the perspective of a human life? Okay, now it makes sense. Back in the day, there was a popular cartoon that had two Fox News-type talking heads braying something like “WHAT can we DO about this TERROR!?!?” and in the next panel a guy turned off the TV. This is what I told my friend the other day: Back then people weren’t being terrorized by Osama bin Laden, but by Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly, and the solution was to stop listening to them.  You’re not being terrorized by Donald Trump, you’re being terrorized by Rachel Maddow. Turn off the TV and get off the internet, and you create a vacuum around Evil that allows it to return to the void. 
On the other hand, how would you use mentally destructive political propaganda as a thrust-block– not for another system of political propaganda, but for the system of your own psyche? I suppose– If you had the personal resources, that is, the superabundance of Good, of internal drive and energy, you could use the existence of these kinds of massed psychic attacks as an impetus to self-development. In my own case it’s another incentive to practice daily banishing rituals to fortify my psychic  environment; to continue to read widely from outside of the contemporary American political spectrum; and to build up my home as a place of refuge from the outside world. I’ve also used my fear of violent Antifas (I believe it’s a legitimate fear in my case, as I used to be part of that crowd and my apostasy is well known in some circles, but even if it isn’t, it was still useful) as an incentive to deepen my martial arts training in case I need to defend myself, and to build up my savings in case I need to leave town. 
On the other hand, I already practiced magic and martial arts before Donald Trump, so this suggests that I may already have been in possession of a “superabundance of Good.” In the case of the friend I talked about above– I don’t know that this approach would work. His energy seems near complete exhaustion and what remains is chaotic; more than anything else he needs a break from the TV and the booze that comes with it. On the other, other hand, I’ve been minimizing my own exposure to news for the last few months and finding myself much happier for that, so… maybe the two approaches aren’t mutually contradictory. Or maybe I just don’t fully understand them. 
Okay. Am I getting this, or is there something I’m still missing? 
I’m sorry if this post is either rambling or redundant. These ideas are difficult, and I find that I can’t understand even a simple problem unless I work through it on my own. No matter how many times I watch you add two and two and get four, I won’t get it until I personally set two apples alongside two other apples and count the total.

JMG–On the subject of space travel–selfish from one point of view–but cast by its advocates as the only hope for humanity. 
Once science established that the Earth will eventually be destroyed as part of the natural life span of the Sun the race for space was no longer just to satisfy our curiosity or to exploit resources; it became a duty to establish colonies. Like a puffball spreading spores, or something. It is just inconceivable to some that the human race may not be the unique and irreplaceable capstone of evolution. More of our duty to our ancestors mentioned earlier in regard to Orson Scott Card’s essay against gay marriage. 
There seems to be a persistent idea that if something ends or disappears its very existence is thereby rendered meaningless. By this logic, no song, film or story should ever end. Yet most wisdom traditions teach that it is the existence of limits that allow meaning in both life and art. Consider the difference between the actual Mona Lisa and a room covered in wallpaper of the Mona Lisa.

Thinking about the personal-physical implications of this, I feel like the “get out of its way” approach is, on a very basic level, what my mother always said about both pimples and mosquito bites: it’ll only get worse if you pick at it. I find this to be true of many negative emotions as well, but the challenge there is to properly get out of the way rather than repress, which seems on the surface like it’s getting out of the way but actually is creating a thrust block for some fairly nasty ongoing stuff, much of the time. Meditation seems to help there, especially some of the thought-redirection aspects: being able to say “Okay, I feel sad and disappointed right now because of X, and that’s all right,” but breathe through it and then go read a book rather than trying to make it go away and then dwelling *or* trying to vent everything right then and making the situation worse. 
One question that interests me is how, in situations where confronting negative evil or its effects directly is necessary (an operation to remove an inflamed appendix, for example), you can use the thrust-block effect for good. What comes to mind for me is either using the recovery time as an opportunity to learn something new/meet new people/etc, or using the situation as an impetus for developing better habits of health, exercise, etc–but I’m not sure whether or not that’s totally off base.

“The Ring-Chaos has its desires turned toward the space that encircles it” – no wonder Spengler identified our culture’s impulse toward the conquest of space as Faustian! I’m also reminded of Lewis’s conception of Hell in The Great Divorce, the lonely grey town expanding endlessly into the darkness as its inhabitants retreat from each other into isolation.
My meditation this morning focused on the impact of the ring-pass-not’s rotation on the alignment (little pun for D&D players) of entities within. Their orientation with respect to the ring-chaos will be constantly changing as the ring-cosmos rotates on its axis, right? But they don’t go from “evil” to “good” to “evil” again, since their relation to the ring-cosmos in which they’re embedded remains the same.
What I thought was that while their fundamental polarity doesn’t change, their ability to act effectively may wax and wane at regular intervals, throughout the cycle of the ring-pass-not. (Btw can I propose we abbreviate these terms going forward? How about Rcos, Rcha, and Rpas?) These would presumably be the kind of cycles that electional astrology is intended track.
Imaginesay, a movement within America that is explicitly and totally anti-American – a 100% embodiment of the anti-religion of America’s civil religion. It’s Rcos is at a perfect right angle to the Rcos of America. Presumably the optimal time to act would be whenever the Rcos of America is passing through the plane of its Rcha.
The question is, how would you recognize such times? The Vietnam war came to mind – the unusual strength of the counterculture during that period could be partly explained by America’s involvement in a colonial war, which you could view as being close to a right angle from our nation’s initial revolution…so to speak 🙂
(To be clear, I’m not suggesting that the peace movement or the hippies actually represent a perfect and total anti-Americanism of the kind I outlined in my initial thought experiment. But they did cast themselves in explicit opposition to the prevailing motion of the larger culture at the time.)

Today’s thoughts on negative evil and entropy. I hope the thinking will justify the length; if not, my apologies.
One way to picture extremes of order and disorder is to Imagine two variations of Borges’s famous Babylon Library. (That metaphorical Library is a vast collection of every possible book of a certain length using a certain alphabet, including every possible book-length sequence of characters and spaces. Assuming the length of each book and the size of the alphabet are somewhat similar to what’s familiar to us, the number of books in the Library is incomprehensibly huge, though finite. Our entire known universe couldn’t begin to hold a hardcopy Babylon Library, even if each book fit into a cubic Planck length, whose sides are 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the width of a proton. In fact, Planck-cube-sized bins filling our entire known universe couldn’t even hold more than a tiny fraction of a collection of all the possible 140-character Tweets.)
The two variations I’m thinking of, call them Libraries A and B, are the same vast size and contain the same collection of books, arranged on some organized sequential array of shelves. But in Library A, all the books are shelved in lexicographic (roughly speaking, alphabetical) order, with the book filled with “aaaaaa….” from beginning to end at one end of the shelf array, and the book of “zzzzzz…” at the other.
In Library B, the books are completely jumbled up, all shelved in random order, as Borges’s original story/essay describes.
Now suppose one wanted to summarize the entire contents of either Library, sufficiently to produce a copy that had the identical arrangement of texts on an identical array of shelves. To summarize Library B, one would need a catalog giving the shelf position for every book, cataloged in the books’ lexicographic order, OR a list of the contents of the book in each sequential shelf position. (This is because there’s no way to uniquely identify a specific book that’s any shorter than the book’s contents.) Either way (or with any combined way no matter how clever) the summary ends up being about the same length as the entire Library itself.
But to summarize Library A, one only needs the simple description already given here and a few pieces of data: the book length, the set of symbols in the alphabet, and the schema for the shelving system. With just that information, an extremely patient and long-lived Librarian, or a computer program a few lines long, could then write/print out a letter-perfect reproduction of Library A, or of the book(s) in any specified shelf position(s).
Those differences between the two Libraries represent extremes of entropy. Library A is very low entropy; that is to say, highly ordered and able to be exactly summarized in extremely compact from. Library B is high entropy; it takes a lot of description to specify its exact state.
We can say that Library B is at “maximum entropy” but there’s a caveat: each book in Library B is still itself a highly ordered system. Vaporizing all the books in Library B into separate ink and paper particles and mixing them all together would give them much higher entropy still. A concept like “maximum entropy” only seems to be meaningful at a given level of granularity, or dare I say within a specific “plane,” of systematic description.
For our purposes, neither extreme on any given plane is desirable or useful. Library A is really nothing more than an encoding (in base n, where n is the number of different symbols in the alphabet) of a list of the integers from 0 to (something like) n to the 500,000th power. That entire Library, written out in full and filling innumerable universes, contains nothing that the previous single sentence hasn’t already fully described. And while Library B cannot be summarized precisely without a huge amount of description, for practical human purposes it can be described quite adequately as “an enormous collection of books of random gibberish.” The vaporized Library B is even easier to describe for practical purposes: “a uniform gaseous mixture of ink and paper particles in such-and-such proportion.”
That’s one of the reasons why entropy (and no doubt, negative evil as well) can be a difficult concept. A volume of a uniform gas mixture might seem more simple, more orderly, than a comparable volume of pages of random symbols. But it only seems so because a non-intuitive comparison “between planes” is involved. You don’t increase order by burning a library, though many have tried! (A clue to the nature of positive evil there, perhaps?)
Speaking of planes or levels of systematic description, in nature as we know it nothing actually opposes or resists entropy. When that seems to occur, entropy is being shifted between such levels, resisted or arrested or even “reversed” in one subsystem by increasing it in another. That’s why refrigeration, the generation of complexity via biological evolution, and the writing of libraries don’t violate the laws of thermodynamics despite representing dramatic local entropy decreases (increased order) at specific levels of description. If the same principle applies to negative evil, that’s an important similarly; if not, it’s an important difference. (Either way, another clue to the nature of positive evil?)
In Fortune’s elaborate metaphor I’d associate the condition of Library B with the Ring-Pass-Not or the Ring-Chaos outside it. And while I haven’t read ahead so I don’t know if Fortune uses or describes the concept of a cosmos-center, given how she describes the negative-evil polarity I’d expect to find Library A there at the opposite extreme, and I’d expect any such center in general to resemble the frozen center of Dante’s hell more than some sort of paradise or perfection.
In any case, we mostly experience the middle reaches, where there are flows and balances and rhythms; where (real) libraries are neither exhaustive nor random but full of meaning; where chaos/entropy/negative evil acts but does not reign.
Stepping back a chapter it occurs to me that, unusually among cosmic metaphors, Fortune’s does not originate at either of its experiential extremes (neither from some perfectly ordered cosmos-center nor from the Ring-Chaos or Ring-Pass-Not which arise later). No primordial atom (e.g. Big Bang) or singular primordial intelligence, and no primordial chaos either.

“You must hate the hate with sufficient force to lock it up…”  I don’t really have much experience of doing that, and less so as I grow older.  But its always been a difficult step for me to take, principally because I’m not sure what’s actually angling for devolution, and what’s just angular to my current direction. This is a course of action to apply only if and when I know I can muster the required passion/energy, which means I must truly know that what I oppose is “positive evil” – whatever that is. 
I’m a bit of a master at the aikidoka approach however … I actively ignore what I perceive as being in opposition. I let it go smash itself into oblivion, or alternatively … prove me wrong.  
Evil is “Live’ spelled backwards.  Love is “Evol” spelled backwards. I’ve known this for several decades, and it has served me well. I choose to put my energy on what I support wholeheartedly. But I have not escaped this current bringing me in seemingly irresolute conflict with most of civilised world/society. I simply don’t understand, for instance, how a judge can rule guilt or innocence, or why I should drive myself hard to achieve a particular goal, when neither the goals nor the means are justifiable. I’ve tasted sufficient wealth (and success) to know it isn’t what I want, and definitely not worth the time/energy/trouble they require. 
There are times, epochs perhaps, when the force of dissolution is on the ascendancy. To gain any purchase one can’t waste one’s time blowing against the wind; I’d rather quietly construct my own alternative reality, and protect it. I have a way of refusing to compromise on my integrity, and wait to ride the updraft currents. One only needs those currents for lift-off … once in the air, there is no lack of support.
And yet … that sentence “you must hate the hate with sufficient force to lock it up…” intrigues me.  It suggests there are instances when it is right to exert that “nuclear force” I have only really experienced in destructive manifestations of rage, and in life-threatening moments.  I have no experience of summoning hate – it only “happens”, and usually with piss-poor consequences. 
My question is … what could be worth the energy needed to summon hate, and block evil, when evil itself is only a value perceived as such because at odds with my preferred outcomes? I guess that’s my first meditation.

I took several physics classes and they trained my brain to start with as simple a system as you can imagine.  
So I am thinking about a simple system (cosmos) that makes music – a violin with a single string.
 I am thinking that the bow is the ring cosmos and the violin is ring chaos.   The motion of the bow is resisted by the sting held in tension.  The friction (resistance) between the bow and string sets the string in motion and produces the music.  The violin is an example of negative evil that dissipates the energy of the bow by resisting its motion.   (the structure of the sting and violin make sure that the energy is dissipated in a structured way)
Is that the right way to think about it ?  because I started out thinking that the violin was the ring cosmos.  But if I am looking at this example correctly ring chaos and negative evil can be beautiful and well structured.

One of the things I’m noticing as I think through examples of negative evil and how they work is the frequency with which someone else can build on an “evil”* locked in place. Locking an evil in place without a plan of action thus seems really dumb.
*I’m putting air quotes there since “evil” isn’t a useful term as far as I can tell: it covers too much to be useful.
Steve: 
I’m not sure what the obsession with Nazis is either. I only used them because they were mentioned, and they could make a point that had occurred to me (the one about polities falling). If I’d picked any other example it would still work, so that was just my sense of humor getting the best of me.

Expat had hit on this somewhat, so hopefully I’ll be safe in making the following point (and if not, I fully understand if you delete my post): the persistence of certain infamous ideologies past what we might consider their sell-by date probably has something to do with how hard they’ve been pushed against since, oh, 1945. I’ve read arguments (which I find convincing) that the narrative structure surrounding the Allied conflict with such ideologies fulfills the same purpose in Western culture as foundational myths do in other cultures. In other words, Western culture requires the persistence and reification of certain ideological “evils” in order to maintain a particular cultural trajectory.
Where likelier candidates aren’t to be found, others (e.g. Qaddafi, Hussein, Bin Laden, etc.) are shoehorned into the role.

The passage me of how important balance is – the two forces must co-exist or the cosmos itself will either implode or explode. Taking this analogy a step further, it seems as though the universe we are currently experiencing together must eventually explode unless time itself can be reversed. Perhaps the entire purpose of this universe that is currently in motion is to be the thrust block to the human discovery of time manipulation? Or inter-cosmos travel?
Also, this idea s very much related to your recent post on the Alt-right and the Ctrl-Left – it seems as though real trouble is inevitable when one gets too close to the periphery of any system.
I like the idea that there are an infinite number of cosmoi and they all impact one another. As I read this it brought to mind a passage at the end of Siddhartha: 
He no longer saw the face of his friend Siddhartha, instead he saw other
faces, many, a long sequence, a flowing river of faces, of hundreds, of thousands,
which all came and disappeared, and yet all seemed to be there simultaneously,
which all constantly changed and renewed themselves, and
which were still all Siddhartha. He saw the face of a fish, a carp, with
an infinitely painfully opened mouth, the face of a dying fish, with fading
eyes—he saw the face of a new-born child, red and full of wrinkles,
distorted from crying—he saw the face of a murderer, he saw him plunging
a knife into the body of another person—he saw, in the same second,
this criminal in bondage, kneeling and his head being chopped off by the
executioner with one blow of his sword—he saw the bodies of men and
women, naked in positions and cramps of frenzied love—he saw corpses
stretched out, motionless, cold, void—he saw the heads of animals, of
boars, of crocodiles, of elephants, of bulls, of birds—he saw gods, saw
Krishna, saw Agni—he saw all of these figures and faces in a thousand relationships
with one another, each one helping the other, loving it, hating
it, destroying it, giving re-birth to it, each one was a will to die, a passionately
painful confession of transitoriness, and yet none of them died, each
one only transformed, was always re-born, received evermore a new face,
without any time having passed between the one and the other face—and
all of these figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated
along and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered
by something thin, without individuality of its own, but yet existing, like
a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of water,
and this mask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha’s smiling
face, which he, Govinda, in this very same moment touched with his lips.

Hi JMG,
After I read this post I went out to mow the lawn. Other people do walking meditation; I do lawn-mowing meditation. 😉
During the meditation I thought about the severe thunderstorm which rolled through this area on June 28. When the siren went off to announce a tornado warning, my husband Mike was cooking chicken on our electric stove. He and I went into the basement to wait out the storm. Soon the electricity went off, which made it impossible to continue cooking the chicken. In this example, eating chicken for dinner is the Ring Cosmos, and the lack of electricity is the Ring Chaos.
Our two strategies became these:
1. Passive: decide we weren’t hungry after all and skip dinner altogether, or give up on the chicken and eat crackers and cheese for dinner. In this case we let the lack of electricity pass out of our lives in its due time.
2. Thrust block: knowing that storms can take the electricity out, we prepare by having non-electric means for cooking on hand. This way we snicker at the outage and get to eat chicken for dinner as planned.
In practice we had to wait for about 45 minutes for the storm to leave the area; then Mike finished cooking the chicken on the gas grill. So we got to eat the chicken no matter what the electricity did. (Turns out it wasn’t a tornado but was high straight-line winds that played havoc with the many old silver maples that are planted too close to electric lines. It was about 40 hours later before the electricity was back on.)
As I thought of some more examples, it occurred to me that the first strategy has value in that it can win some breathing time while considering how to work a thrust block. Let’s say I was being harassed by someone. I could learn their schedule well enough to avoid being in their vicinity (passive). That would give me some time to figure out what it might be about myself that I could change that would reduce or eliminate the possibility of future harassment (thrust block). Another way to put it is that ineffective resistance in situations like this focuses on changing others’ behavior, whereas effective thrust-block resistance focuses on changing the conditions within myself which elicit such behaviors. This wouldn’t account for all of the negative evils that could affect me, but I suspect there is a good-sized fraction of them that I could best use as an indication of areas in which I need to make changes in myself to neutralize them.
Do I understand Fortune’s points correctly?

Interesting symbolism, especially the mulitiered cosmoi.  On that subject: In my early adult years, I lived overseas, including three years in a third-world country.  Your comments about finding myself on the outside looking in at American culture are spot on.  I was rather hoping that my experiences would result in something of a “higher synthesis” in my knowledge and beliefs, and perhaps to some extent this has happened.  But it’s a lonely cosmos, as I have found few others who have not had similar experiences to share it with.

John Roth,
I am indeed using the one with the wall of text. I think last month someone linked to the other in pdf…it would be good if we could have those links stay up in the essay each time we do this class.
All,
It seems obvious to me that negative evil is more or less the same as entropy or that entropy is contained within the set of negative evil. I think I said something about that last month. I also think we have a tendency to be prejudiced against entropy but it is really a blessing. No entropy = no existence, no newness, no new chances, everything stuck.

William H,
That Sadhguru guy said something interesting. He said, if you look at a garden you think it is very orderly, and if you look at a forest it looks like chaos. But if you neglect to take care of the garden for a month, you see it is falling apart. But the forest is in perfect harmony and is taking care of itself. I guess this is not a very good analogy because your land is somewhat more garden-like than forest-like, but I am equating it to a forest in that it is a fairly complete ecosystem and has a wild beauty.

In understanding the difference between negative evil and positive evil, I find it useful that schizophrenia has positive symptoms and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms are florid ad active, like speaking in rhyme or nonsense, paranoid delusions and such. But negative symptoms are mainly severe lack of motivation. 
Positive evil is doing something that detracts from another being, like stealing or threatening them. If this happens by intent. I wouldn’t call it evil if a lion kills a wildebeest because it’s hungry.
Negative evil isn’t really action, I don’t think. It’s more like doing nothing when things need to be done, saying nothing when something needs to be said.

								July 13, 2018 at 1:05 am							




Nicholas, thanks for this! I know next to nothing about IT, so it’s intriguing to hear that the same principles apply there. 
David, the interesting thing is that I’ve known a fair number of very old people who are okay with death. Most of them have lived good lives, and are ready for their lives to wind up when the time comes. On the other hand, it’s not unreasonable for people who aren’t yet very old to want to keep living, since they’ve got a fair chance at many more years of life. 
Steve, good. You’re neither rambling nor redundant; these are genuinely difficult ideas and take some time to grasp. With regard to Fortune’s comment about a superabundance of good, let’s take your example — the torrent of frightening propaganda coming over the TV. If you’re strong enough — if your cosmos has enough momentum in its Ring-Cosmos, let’s say — you can watch the propaganda, recognize what it’s trying to do to you, counter it mentally, and use that to attain something else: for example, greater self-knowledge through watching the propaganda stir up emotional reactions in you. On the other hand, that’s a lot of work, and it’s also an option just to turn off the television. 
Rita, got it in one. You will die someday, so will I, so will every one of us, and so will our species and our entire evolutionary lineage. Coming to terms with that is called “maturity,” and it’s a commodity in very short supply these days…
Isabel, no, it’s not off base at all. Remember too that your conscious mind is not the only thing involved. Surgery is basically the process of turning an illness into a wound, because the body’s good at recovering from wounds, and so part of the response to the negative evil of the inflamed appendix is to give your body a chance to do a general healing and housecleaning — thus the benefit of bed rest and easily digestible food during the recovery time. 
Fred, Fortune talks about astrology later on, in some interesting ways, and we’ll discuss that when we get to it. Being able to judge the moment when, say, America is at right angles to its original plane of rotation, and has thus turned into its own opposite…that’s a challenge but not an insuperable one, so long as you remember what the original plane of rotation was and can compare it to the present movement! 
Walt, good. There is a center in Fortune’s cosmology, and we’ll be talking about it in the next chapter and repeatedly thereafter; it’s not frozen stillness, though, because it engages in a series of repeated rhythmic interactions with the rest of the Ring-Cosmos. Stay tuned! 
Marco, and it’s a good meditation. You can choose to lock up a force that’s at right angles to your own Ring-Cosmos, but you do it — as Fortune says — when you want to fix it in place, and use your relationship with it as a source of stability. Thus, for example, you might look at some aspect of the society in which you live, and reject that, so that your rejection and the thing in society form something solid in your life; whatever else you do is conditioned by your rejection of that aspect of your society; and you then go on to do something else on the basis of that presence and its rejection. I loathe television, for example, and I choose to make my rejection of it something enduring; once the TV has gone crashing into the dumpster, I then follow through on the rejection by finding other things to do with my time, such as writing, playing a musical instrument, joining a lodge, or what have you. 
Jim, to my mind the Ring-Cosmos and the Ring-Chaos are much simpler and more basic than that. The Ring-Cosmos is sound, the Ring-Chaos silence, the Ring-Pass-Not is rhythm. Once you’re down to violins, you’re in complexities we won’t get to until much further on in the system of thought!

I was just today in a pointed conversation re the nature of (my) inner work and, as is not uncommon for me, I felt myself digging in to resistance.  It is like a palpable thing that rises in my chest.  I watch it happen; I know what is happening; and I can’t stop it.  I know the other person is right.  I know intellectually what the situation is, what needs to be done (or not done).  Reframing my issues, my mind is not who I am, I am the actor and not the role, the purpose of the dance is itself, construction and destruction are both elements of existence.  I know these things, but in these moments I refuse to accept them — and I’m back where I was before, searching for that absolute anchor, that point of reference which will bring order, meaning,  and permanence to existence.  I want to not go through this, but it seems the only way to manage it is to let it pass, to let it sping along Ring-Chaos out into the void.  Talking through it (resisting the resistance) seems to just make it worse and the resistance more intense.  Very frustrating, since I’ve got crap to do and a cosmos to attempt to comprehend.  I’d like to focus time on that and not dealing with the fog of emotion like this.  Can’t we just dwell in the Supernal triangle and not have to dally about with Yesod, Hod, and Netzach?  (Ok — that question was rhetorical.  I know the answer.  I just have to accept it.)
Sigh.  And double-sigh.

Let me try this:
1) Okay, so a building falling apart due to time and neglect would be a passive evil, provided that your ring-cosmos aligned with the building’s ring-cosmos.
2) Concrete is a good building material and is very strong in compression and pretty good in shear, but has minimal tensile strength.  From the perspective of a builder, concrete’s excellent tensile properties and ease of use align with the ring-cosmos, but its weak tensile strength is aligned with the builder’s ring-chaos.
3) A building like the Parthenon is built by letting the passive evil of concrete whirl away into the Ring-Pass-Not (of  concrete, the people who built it. the concrete or the Parthenon, I’m not sure I know which) by only using concrete in compression, which is why the Parthenon still exists.
4) A building like a parking garage is built by resisting the passive evil of concrete, by putting pretensioned steel rods into the concrete to pull all of the concrete into compression, thereby allowing the construction of a mostly-concrete structure with elements that would be impossible in pure concrete.  (You could build a durable all-concrete parking garage, but you would have to include space for arches and pay for all the extra concrete that would consume).
5) In the example of the parking garage (or any other prestressed concrete construction, of which there is quite a lot in the industrial world), the passive evil of concrete has been locked into place – it isn’t making the structure break, but prestressed concrete structures have short lifetimes even with extensive and costly maintenance because water inevitably gets in and rusts the steel tension members away, letting the low tensile strength of concrete back into play.

Well, I’ve read half the book and now that I re-read the first chapter it is much more meaningful. It’s a book that will unfold into deeper and deeper layers. Funny enough, it reminds me of Beowulf in it’s difficulty to decipher with great reward.
I still don’t understand why it’s important to imagine the two rings at right angles (originally I was imagining their axes as right angles. It’s much easier to imagine them on the same axis going opposite directions. Thank you for the clarification.) My inclination is to imagine them in motion, so most of the time they would be not at right angles. Why should I imagine them stationary? The starting orientation before spinning is the most important? Also in a future month, I hope you will explain what Logos is. I looked up the definition, but I still don’t understand in this context.
Various thoughts on the reading and some is in response to other comments:
Tainter/Seneca Effect:
Society becomes increasingly complex to solve problems (many of which the complexity created – such as desertification caused by industrial farming) This requires ever-increasing amounts of energy. Eventually it becomes impossible to maintain – it overshoots and collapses. From the perspective of The Cosmic Doctrine: Evolution is the movement toward complexity in a fractal growth pattern. Something like a tree or neural branches. Some branches do not find homeostasis and pruning (Devolution) occurs. So increased complexity or Evolution, should not be assumed to be good. Just like Devolution should not be assumed to be evil.
Magic circle:
I’ve been thinking about outside of the Cosmos, and I think it is zero dimensional, as in nothing, no space. I don’t know how to imagine that, but it’s the conclusion I’ve come to. Whereas, within the cosmos, there are fractal replicas of the cosmos, but outside of their borders, something exists. So it’s not an exact replica, but it’s the border that matters, the barrier between ‘me’ and ‘not me’. If there is no border, you don’t have any power. There’s nothing to push off from. 
Nation borders:
The imaginary border of a nation is an example of this power. When I hear people calling for “no borders,” I don’t think they understand how extreme that is, how destructive that would be. I understand the desire to feel empathy for all people of the world, but seriously, you can’t have everyone in your circle, then the circle doesn’t exist.
The book was originally secret because she thought it could be dangerous in the wrong hands:
I’m curious about why you would use it for the book club, if you also believed it could be dangerous. She does mention why it is dangerous in a later chapter. But that left me unsatisfied. I wonder if there is something even more dangerous that she wouldn’t even mention. Also, simply defining it as dangerous gives it some special magnetism. So, she is using the principles of the book within the book. I’m also curious about why you would put your cross-street in your blog, perhaps to spin that sort of attention out of your Ring-Pass-Not? 
I’ve written a lot more about my thoughts on dimensions, the Ring-Pass-Not, and Yin-Yang, but I will save it for another time.

@JMG and David, re: death: I’m currently at home with my parents, who are in their late sixties/early seventies. Both of *them* are (or at least seem, though I admit they may be putting on an act for my sake) fine with the notion of death–when they go, they go, and so forth. The notion of losing them bothers the heck out of me, more so in some ways than the eventual prospect of my own death*–I don’t feel at all ready to be the oldest generation in the family–but they both are very much of the opinion that you do what you reasonably and enjoyably can with medicine and healthy living, but living to a hundred doesn’t sound like fun.
@JMG: That’s an excellent point! Of late–actually, starting around the time I started meditating and so forth–I almost welcome the times when I have a cold or minor illness, because it’s an excuse to stay in, go to bed early, and so forth, often on an occasion when I really need it.  (The sinus part, not so much. I don’t know that I’ll ever be spiritually advanced enough not to hate a runny nose.) I’ve started feeling the same way about the first two months or so of winter, too: even when I don’t get to work from home, there’s still something satisfying about a regular signal from the world to stop running around and get some rest.
@Fred: If I recall my excessive true-crime reading correctly, a few of the small groups within that counterculture did define themselves as pretty explicitly and actively against America or American society, and with results that seem to go along with the “dangers of working dynamically with evil” warning: namely, the SLA, the Peoples Temple, and the Manson Family. 
My mom’s currently watching a Ken Burns documentary on Prohibition, and it does seem like a really good example of how direct opposition really does lock a thing in place, and this particular form of opposition to a negative evil (the mammalian tendency to act ridiculous and sometimes get violent after an excess of fermented substance) made everything worse.
* I’m vaguely dismayed when I think of the number of books I likely won’t get to read, but still.

I think part of what Fortune means about the need for a superabundance of good is that it’s not enough to simply desire to resist something you see as evil. You have to have a genuine drive to create something, or build on something you love. A desire to preserve the status quo doesn’t cut it if you want to genuinely oppose evil rather than just letting it run its course.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								July 13, 2018 at 4:17 am							




Will, excellent. Yes, exactly — you only use opposition to lock something in place if you’ve already got the plan and the resources in place to do something constructive with it. If not, you may find that it’s you who’s been locked in place, and somebody else is building on top of your opposition…
Nicholas, I ain’t arguing. Have you noticed, along the same lines, how deeply dependent American society is on having an opposing force identified with the color red? From the redcoats to the Native Americans to the Communists to the, ahem, red states, it’s rather distinctive…
Docshibby, anything that gets a Hesse quote is a good thing in my book. 😉
SLClaire, you do indeed. Thank you! 
Helix, it may well have resulted in a higher synthesis, but you’re facing the usual problem faced by those who make a higher synthesis — those who don’t have the raw materials to synthesize it for themselves generally can’t make heads or tails of it. 
Onething, true enough. As our text says, if the Ring-Cosmos has everything its own way, you get a static condition. Both rings are necessary. 
Tripp, good. Clearly the spider and the fly have their Ring-Cosmoi at decidedly different angles! 
Pogonip, you can certainly talk about Stalin; given that his regime killed around three times as many people as Hitler’s, he deserves more discussion than he gets. My prohibition of talk about Nazis is a function of the way that the Nazi regime has come to function as a black hole for thinking.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								July 13, 2018 at 4:28 am							




David, have you considered giving a voice to your resistance and seeing what it says to you? Journaling is great for that; just pick up a pen, ask your resistance to explain to you why it does what it does, and imagine it answering you — and write down every single word without censoring anything, no matter how crazy or scary or absurd it becomes. It’s by bringing such things up into the light of consciousness that we can sort them out. 
Justin, fascinating. That makes sense. When you get to either of the two Hesse books, imagine Jung’s Red Book as playing a role in the story…
Radha, the point about imagining the rings at right angles is that it makes it easier to understand some of the passages in this chapter that use that specific symbolism. If you’ve got the point of those passages, don’t worry about the right angles. As for the Cos. Doc’s dangerousness, I think Fortune greatly overestimated the ability of the average reader to make sense of it. It’s been readily available in print since the 1950s, there have been classes taught publicly on it and at least one doctoral dissertation published on it; if it was going to cause problems, it would have caused them already — instead, most people who try reading it give up after a few pages, so I think an online discussion group will be fine. 
Isabel, no argument there. I think middle age does the same thing in terms of the life cycle. 
Fred, very good. Exactly; if you want to preserve the status quo, evade the evil, don’t fight it. If you fight it things are going to change.

@Marcos It occurs to me that you may be taking the word “hate” too literally. What do you do when you hate something?
Recoil from it, reject it fundamentally, do not let it take space, define yourself in opposition. Move away from it in all manner of ways. – it doesn’t require expression of rage or anger, necessarily. 
Similarly, this is why Fortune says the doctrine of meeting hate with love fails so often. What do you do when you love something? 
Think if it, fantasize about it, imitate it, try to become it or something it would approve of. Go toward it, embrace it. It isn’t necessarily positive; infatuation, obsession is mistaken for love.
I struggled with this passage, as it seems to give one an excuse to do nothing in the face of challenges, and declare you are just letting evil reach dissolution, man. Be a wimp, or a doormat, and declare your goodness. I have always found a contingent of people who like to think of themselves as “just too nice to say anything” are actually just cowardly, and afraid of being disliked at all by anyone.
So I think there is a very important point in here about the fact that entropy, or negative evil, is the factor that stabilizes the cosmos, and is a thrust block – if what you are doing is not hating the thing, not running in the intentional way where you know what the thing is, but rather in a fearful way in the manner of a child, you are not truly letting the evil dissipate, nor using it as a thrust block for good as you could. You are goin not at right angles, around it, but opposite to it, in the direction that counters all movement, and removes the potential for good.
At least, that’s what I’m telling myself – there is a trick of engagement hidden in the use of “hate” – it is not passive. Aikido takes tremendous skill and little to throw a man with a crook of your finger – you must be paying attention, but soft, not just floppy.

Hello, here’s a thing.  When I was reading through the correspondences set out for Ring Cosmos (Good, Life, Light, Spirit, Being, God) and Ring-Chaos (Evil, Death, Darkness, Matter, Not-Being, Devil) “because each of these potencies has its root in its respective Ring”, I found myself jarred, or resistant to seeing the pair Spirit/Matter in this terms.  
Initially, because in terms commonly used, matter is conceived of as the densest (“most manifested”?) plane of manifestation (and so, closer to the “centre” of Ring-Cosmos’s sphere, as it were.  Whereas spirit is conceived of as less dense, perhaps less complex, and less “concretely” (Ring-Cosmos preference?) manifested as matter, and closer, perhaps, than matter, to the original Unmanifest.
Secondly, in personal experience, matter and spirit are tied up so closely together that I cannot think of how to experience one without the other, and their separation is, for me, a matter of language and conceptual categorisation, only, and not of experience.  Whatever I am, whatever living beings I know and interact with are, are spiritual matter or material spirit, in some indivisible way. 
So I tried to think of myself as a miniature set of Rings.  My “Ring-Cosmos” being my spirit seeking to evolve, to complexify, to integrate and “extend my centre”, to “solidify by contraction”, and my “Ring-Chaos” being my matter seeking to devolve, to de-compose, to disintegrate, to “extend my circumference”, to turn to “space that encompasses it”.  This would give my spirit some interesting “earthy” qualities I had not formerly associated with it, and likewise give my matter some interesting etherial qualities likewise not formerly evident. 
I came back then to the thought, “remember, these are metaphors”….

Not only does Stalin deserve more attention than he gets, but I’ll bet most of these idiots running around yelling about He—Who-Must-Not-Be-Babbled-About-In-This-Discussion couldn’t identify 10 leading Nazis or intelligently discuss the reasons why they came to power.

@JMG
I’m a little late to the discussion but have been trying to catch up on the last two posts. Of all of various associated references that might help me to understand / visualise the Cos Doc, I’m most familiar with systems theory and complexity, so have been trying to build some bridges from those directions. 
So, is it on track to think of the ring cosmos as being akin to positive or reinforcing feedback, the ring chaos to negative or balancing feedback, and the ring pass-not as a description of the kind of dynamically stable over time patterns that emerge from the interation of the two, giving the system as a whole a kind of identity or boundary condition?

Oops, paragraph 2 of my previous post should read:
2) Concrete is a good building material and is very strong in compression and pretty good in shear, but has minimal tensile strength. From the perspective of a builder, concrete’s excellent compressive properties and ease of use align with the ring-cosmos, but its weak tensile strength is aligned with the builder’s ring-chaos
I take it my use of the Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos and Ring-Pass-Not was correct in my Parthenon vs. Parking Garage example?.

JMG
Thank you again for your very helpful explanation and intro. I persevere very gently. I hope I am seeing a little of the same effect – improving – as Violet. ‘Clearing up’ personal environment as it were improves the platforms we find our ‘point of view’ standing on.
Reviewing matters so far as I understand them:
1.	DF’s story of the source of these teachings can be disregarded for our purposes.
2.	Similarly, the DF model from physics does not have to be accurate about physics: these are symbols not information. I am glad about that. I usually can visualize points of view from platforms inside the gear-box as it were of Newtonian physics from micro to macro – centripetal and centrifugal ‘forces’,  friction and drag, torque and so on, even angles of illumination and throw in a bit of quantized energy transfer, but admit to having struggled with DF’s geometry.
3.	A commenter a month ago raised the comparison with ‘systems theory’ and you replied that he might be onto a good thing, and so this month it proved.
My comment just now is that ‘systems theory’, like ‘chaos theory’ seems fully compatible still with an entirely ‘deterministic’ account of the universe.  DF earlier, however, brought in ‘desire’ and repeats it in the text we are looking at: page 20 and again on 22 of the hard copy edition I am looking at. Well, ‘desire’ can be part of the pre-programming I suppose of deterministic / emergent behavior, but it seems to connect both conscious and unconscious with a dynamic effect on the solid – ‘solid’ for want of a better word.
As a bit of a non-sequitur our Meteorological Office has had to give up its monopoly of information to diverse on-line services. Even the BBC has bought into an alternative service. A friend described his wife as reviewing the different accounts – we usually have locally very variable weather – and choosing the one she likes. Her Standing Stones outdoor theatrical was actually perfect this June 21st. Just goes to show. Smile.

Whew! Reflecting on the depth of thought in all these comments makes me feel about 2 inches tall. 
You said, in reply ‘if you want to preserve the status quo, evade the evil, don’t fight it. If you fight it things are going to change’. 
This reminds me of a saying (Will Rogers, I think) to the effect that, if you see ten troubles coming down the road toward you, don’t run out to meet them; nine will run into the ditch before they get to you.
This leads me to want to be on the lookout for proverbs, quotes, etc. which capture a bit of the wisdom of The Cosmic Doctrine. I’m expecting them to be everywhere once I’m duly sensitized. I’ve got an inkling that actually it’s present in every meaningful tension that exists, but a good aphorism or saying is a bite-sized chunk that’s easy to remember and recall when you need to put something into perspective.

I enjoyed David’s comment, and your suggestion in reply.  The rubber hits the road for me when the dynamics of the rings can be seen playing out in my inner world.  You suggested journaling, and I would add painting as a path that allows those deeper forces to be consciously seen.  At the end of the day, it seems to me that the text is leading me to accept that everything in the cosmos has its place and reason. As a corollary, everything in me has its place and reason. Unconscious suppression is not the answer.
I thought of astrology as a profound analogy for explicating these dynamics. Maybe my birth-chart is my Ring-Cosmos, and as I move I generate a Ring-Chaos. The passage through time generates the sphere of the Ring-PassNot.  At any given moment those foundational angles in my birth-chart are impacted by the changing angles of the shifting spheres on the Ring-Chaos.  
The first place these influences manifest is in my inner world of feeling and thought. Surely this is where the real action is.  Jung predicted the rise of nazism through his experience of the archetypal forces at work in human nature, his own in primis. That’s where the choice of letting or resisting evil might be usefully applied. It seems to me that by the time these manifest in the external world … its too late to do anything about them; then we are just reacting to projected images in Plato’s cave. 
I was 12 years old when I moved from Italy to Zimbabwe (Rhodesia at the time).  I was 19 when I moved to Cape Town, South Africa.  I was 27 when I moved to France, after a year in Italy. I was 36 when I moved to Spain, and 39 when I moved to Seattle, WA. I was 46 when I moved to London, UK, and 50 when I moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands. I was 56 when I moved to La Gomera, Canary Islands, Spain. I have unaspected Jupiter in the 9th House of my birth chart.  I know intimately what it feels like to enter a national cosmos, adapt to belong, then leave it and enter a new one.  Every culture has essential values, essential voids, magnificent uniqueness, and gross exaggerations. None are worth basing one’s identity on.

John–
Re journaling
I appreciate that advice.  I may have to concede defeat and give that a try.  My wife has been journaling for many years now to some effect.  Of course, the whole reason I have these things taped up tightly in a small box and tucked away in a dark corner of the attic is precisely so I that *wouldn’t* have to waste time dealing with them in the first place, but it seems that I ultimately don’t have a choice in the matter.  Eh bien.
As usual, much of the intensity of the resistance had passed when I woke this morning.  This is par for the course.  I was laughing at myself yesterday during the conversation I referenced earlier, because practically everything my wife was saying (in slightly different language, of course) paralleled what we are studying here in Cos Doc or what I’m studying in the DA course or what I’ve been told in meditation.   Again, understanding all this is one thing; incorporating it into my life is something else entirely.  Understanding that “the point of the dance is itself” — that existence is the self-referential foundation of meaning and that meaning is ultimately subjective, not objective  — is well and good.  Being able to look at that and not throw one’s hand’s up in despair while lamenting “then nothing means anything because all meaning is just made up” (because, of course, only the objective is real) is a different challenge altogether and one with which I struggle regularly.  I lock myself up, in the language of this month’s discussion here.
I keep stubbornly trying to fit this existence into a purely intellectual framework and existence is having none of it.  The wrestling match is, among other things, with the voices that tell me I should be doing grand works, not “sitting with my emotions” to peel back layers of childhood issues from when I was sent to my room when I was three or from our having to move every other year (as a military family).  But, as you pointed out the “necessity of Ares,” there is a necessity for these other factors as well, regardless of my preferences to the contrary.  I’ll have to deal.

I was thinking about this passage and it reminded me of an epiphany I had a few months ago while meditating – that what I seek to do while meditating is finding the quiet in the chaos. After reading this I wonder if I was on some level using the chaos to find the silence – that the two are mutually interdependent and the chaos of my mind is actually the thrust-block to find the quiet.
That lead me to think about the the creative process and the act of creation – that the act of creation (manifestation) is “intent” (movement in Ms Fortune’s terminology) passing through chaos to manifest. Which would mean that all manifestation is intention filtered/effected by chaos. It reminds me of Citta in yoga and the quest to still the citta as much as possible to find truth (intention).

I’m hoping JMG and the readership can help me on this one.  Thinking of Fortune’s statement “You must hate the hate sufficiently to cause a locking up of the force.”  The Ctrl-Left always says its marches and protests are “against hatred”.  For example, the other day when I went to Chicago, there was a woman shouting “November is too late!  Stop the fascists and their hate!”  on Michigan Avenue.  She had a megaphone.  Is it that the Ctrl-Left only pretends to hate Trump, and that they secretly thrill at the prospect of working themselves up into a foam over his every move?  Because they haven’t surrounded Trump with a vacuum, they’ve given him a surplus of potency?  Am I on the right track if I say they love their own hatred?  Therefore, if they hated their own hatred and refused to engage with it, would they be able to vanquish their opposition?  Their hatred of Trump’s supposed hatefulness seems genuine enough.

Since it came up…I’m super curious what it is about “red” that the egregore of the United States finds so offensive.  I mean, our flag is red, white and blue after all, and red is always mentioned first!  Red is, after all, the color of vitality, healing, protection and blessing.
Is this an age of Pisces thing, with the devil in red and people at war with their ‘animal’ halves?  I really find it baffling and sinister; the whole war on nature, which is positive evil if I’ve ever seen it, seems to be predicated on exactly the same line of thinking as the ‘red enemy’.
That being said, this battle against the Red Enemy has allowed for a mighty nation and empire to be built up from the forces of opposition, so there is that.  And there has been a great deal of stability as well, at least as politics goes, derived from the forces of opposition.  So there’s that too.  Still, as a mythic structure, I find it utterly confusing and counter-intuitive.  Any clarifying thoughts on this is most appreciated!

@JMG, @Violet
First off, thank you JMG for getting this discussion going. For the first time I now have a daily meditation practice, which is in itself rewarding, but the thoughts provoked by reflection and further stirred by comments here are quite wonderful above and beyond that.
Last week’s discussion of the Alt-Right arising in response to the Ctrl-Left had me reflecting on their correspondence to the Ring-Chaos and the Ring-Cosmos, respectively. But if I understand Jordan Peterson’s position correctly (just cracking the spine of his first tome, Maps of Meaning) he diagnoses the Ctrl-Left as a Ring-Chaos arising in response to the Ring-Cosmos of the evolution of western culture, and a symbol of that culture’s dissolution.
This suggests that there can be cosmoi within cosmoi, shadows of shadows. Very interesting! Also curious that from the perspective of the Ctrl-Left, their shadow (the Alt-Right) is indistinguishable from what they themselves shadow (the normative Judeo-Christian morality of the West which Peterson seeks to champion).
As far as I can tell, Peterson seems to be attempting a genuine Second Religiousness of the Faustian Culture, hybridizing science and myth in order to ‘save’ that culture from the forces of Chaos. But it isn’t clear to me at this point whether he is himself a reactionary force or whether he’s using the Ctrl-Left as a thrust-block to in order to work in alignment with the evolution of Western Culture, if the metaphor works in this sense. The fact that he’s championing tradition and conservative moral values in some sense suggests a Ring-Cosmos kind of aspiration on his part.
Is my geometry way off here, or am I spinning at a sensible angle?

On the peak oil question…
I see the hard opposition to the idea as the continuing fingers in ears, la-la-la, peak oil can’t exist if we keep pretending really hard that it doesn’t! 
Of course there are myriad symptoms of this option/illness – the umpteen trillion dollar federal debt (does the number really matter), the decaying infrastructure in the teeth of imagined progress, the ongoing ethanol illusion and its cascading collateral damage, electric cars, cold fusion, and so on. 
The get out of the way and let it spin out into oblivion option is probably best correlated to your “collapse now and avoid the rush” admonition. Once one has truly collapsed to a lower energy/resource level the predicament of peak oil kind of goes away, as Fortune suggests. At least for, perhaps, that generational cycle. 
For our part, we’ve mostly done that bit, at our rural homestead anyway, and are starting to think about the next round of challenges: namely life on foot, and probably in or much closer to town. We don’t see it as abandon one and adopt the other though, but more of a both/and between us and our children (I.e. the next generational challenge)

Hi JMG – I just want to say that this: “Surgery is basically the process of turning an illness into a wound, because the body’s good at recovering from wounds, and so part of the response to the negative evil of the inflamed appendix is to give your body a chance to do a general healing and housecleaning” is beautifully put, and makes a lot of clinical sense.

According to the “oppose and make it concrete” option, it seems to me that the evangelical Christian church is largely responsible for making Satan as powerful as they claim him to be.  They’re always on about the evil works of Satan, and demons under every mattress. I don’t give Satan much of my brain-space, and so he seems a trifling character to me, if he exists at all.

Hi JMG,
I found that I particularly resonated with the “resist not evil” from the currant reading.  It was something that a friend and I were discussing just very recently.  I have had experience with this from time to time, but it always seemed so random when it worked for me.  I think I am starting to getting the drift about negative and positive evil and how they are used should you be so inclined.  
“Resist not evil” was something I thought our country should have done with 9/11, but instead we chose to fight back and, lo, international terrorism seems to be a fixture of our modern age.  I think the trick is to be able to wisely or strategically choose your battles.  Guess this is where divination and meditation come into play.
Wonderful stuff.
David,
I would certainly want to become a subscriber to your occult journal.  I think it would be a fascinating read.







 Christopher L Hope says:

I hope this isn’t too basic – it goes back to last month’s reading- I want to get the basics down before going further.   The ring-cosmos is slightly stronger than the ring-chaos.   This is why it overcomes inertia.   Because inertia has been overcome, the spin produces an ever changing interaction between it’s force and the force of the the ring-chaos.     (I’m thinking that if cosmos couldn’t overcome inertia the opposing forces would be equal and therefore everything would be in stasis)     
“The ring-chaos does not belong to the universe it encircles, but to outer space.”    IOWs the ring-chaos is the unmanifest ?    So what we’re being asked to imagine with these symbols is the interplay of the manifest and unmanifest, bounded by the ring-pass not ?     
I hope I’m understanding correctly.  This is indeed tough going, at least for me.   
As an aside I was, like others here, taken by the idea that what is resisted is made persistant.    The current political situation makes it easy to see how resistance can be used as a thrust block.

@kimberleysteele007
I think what trips us up about why “hating the hate” doesn’t mean frothing through a microphone, as it would seem to imply, is the *second* hate there. “The hate” is not “Donald Trump”. It is what the Resistance claims he stands for .
So, since this is how the Resistance is actually using it – I’m sorry, JMG, Nazis: my friend shared a meme that goes like this, “we have a saying in Germany, if there are ten people around a table, then they let one Nazi sit down, there are 11 Nazis at the table”. This is being used to explain why under no circumstances should anyone with any sympathy toward issues that could be said to align with Trump, Trumpism/ Tories/ Conservatives be allowed to express their views at all, because it makes everyone  equal to all bad things imaginable . This is obviously… Fascism, the grossest sorry of scapegoating entire groups and systems of belief and intolerance they claim to be stamping out. They aren’t hating “the hate”, they’re doing it, fixated on it – loving it.
To hate the hate in this example, the woman with the microphone should be telling “come tell me why you believe differently!” Or ” If you think we need immigration reform to increase humane treatment of refugees and Americans losing their jobs to import slave labor, let’s come up with policy options for a petition to government!”. 
If you hate manipulating people with fear, engage their rational faculties.
If you hate rude slurs and petty insults in your public discourse, don’t use it to attach your opponent.
If you hate attacks on science and civil liberties, use science yourself, and don’t try to restrict civil liberties.

Hello JMG,
I love the Ashley Technique! 
Building on some hazy, part-formed strategies of my past, I’ll clarify them based on that & what I’ve been reading here:
Something is “in my way”, assuming I know what the objectives of “my way” are- helps to have a clue about that first. “My way” being all the activities and situations I don’t wish to be diverted from within the cosmos of the kind of life I want to live, and the pursuit of sorts of questions I earnestly seek answers for.
Is it really in my way, or am I altering the angle of my path to -make it be in my way-, based on some emotional or other internal reaction?
If it is, can I go around it? (& can I “let it go”?)
If I can’t go around it, can I use it and my reaction to it in some way?
So simple, yet often so full of snarly bits.
Emotional continence can be so difficult!

(I dare say the log in tech for this site will get my goat one of these days. My ring cosmos is getting ever more perpendicular to the ring of technology!)
“The Ring-Cosmos seeks to *extend* the centre.”
This is odd to me, in the way I have visualized thus far I would have said that the Cosmic whirl seeks to approach or contract around the center…. I will play with some different options on how to visualize this; but at present this seeks quirky to me.
“The Ring-Cosmos, if its influence were unchecked, would be static in the immediate present.”
Thus is the case with a mathematical construct. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCpLWbHVNhk
This mathamatical object is what it is because its ring-pass-not is finite, and in a sense isolated from chaos by a precisely defined limit. Yet, even in this absurdly tiny and simple limit there is more resolution than can be represented of our Universe in all the terms of science. Yet, it is static, the way that the forms related to each other and the pattern iterate is all static. Of course there is a bunch of chaos involved in the process of representing this math thing to people. For contrast consider the much much more limited zoom of our universe as the Science of the 70’s could represent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0
For comparison the mandobrot zoom (my first link) zooms to a depth of [1970’s limits of theoretical scientific resolution of our universe] to the power of 27. I love the sublime effect of things far beyond the resolution limits of my imagination.
It seems unlikely that the essence of any soul which has chaos around it, and can give birth to a dancing star could contain any less beauty than a mere fractal. 
In any case it seems to me that a ring cosmos seeks to become itself. To pull inward toward an ideal that it is always surrounding, a strange attractor. But what it is that it is to become is in communion with its ring chaos. The object of math, which is in representation pulled aside from chaos, is static in the immediate present. Only what lives in the relationship of the two forces, in their difference, is free. Freed by the sum chaos of all which IS; though ironicallly captured between that very chaos’ elder gods (so to speak) and its own order, its own ITSELF.
Each Ring Cosmic may be rotated in relation to another in any number of dimensions needed to make a point, though 3 is going to be the limit of the usefulness of all but very quirky imaginations. The example I explored was one where there can be a comparison of two Cosmoi; such that ring cosmic of cosmos A is perpendicular to both the ring chaos and the ring comsic of cosmos B, and the ring chaos of cosmos A is aligned with the ring cosmos of cosmos B. There are a gaggle of examples one could meditate on. The one I described has some interesting asymmetries; specifically B is imperceptible to A; but the chaos of A shares energy with the order of B. Poor A could be gobbled up should they get too close! and with its own comsic ring being a jar from either of B’s rings it only senses danger as though it were from the vague threat of its own mysteriously swelling ring chaos. That’s a Lovecraftian relation right there!
Each cosmos is like a monad, and in chaos if not in order reflects all the cosmos beyond itself.
Evil prevents the spirit from falling into itself into the permanent eternal now at the center of its ring. A spirit cannot be lost completely, but evil could pull it so far out from a nuanced manifestation that what remains might seems to another soul closer to matter than spirit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkcAH-m9W0
Johnny Cash’s verse:
“I fly a star-ship, across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I’ll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I’ll be back again, and again and again and again and again﻿”
Even reincarnation makes a touch more sense in this light. There is a ‘strange attractor’ that is at the heart of the whirl that I am, and even when the matter that I am made of spins out of context, the attractor remains. Like the bend in a ditch where one little whirl pool after the next is born as the water flows by, as the bank erodes the whirl pools evolve.
There are a couple more meditations that have sprung up, but its getting too late to do them justice now.

Two political examples of making something stronger by opposing it forcefully.
The slogan ‘Action-Reaction-Action’ was very popular among the Revolutionary Left (ie real revolutionaries, kidnapping, murdering ones)  in Europe in the 60’s and 70’s.
The rather cynical theory was that an attack on the state leads to a violent reaction( and nice crop of heroic martyrs and innocent victims)  which serves as the basis for an even stronger attack by the forces of revolution, leading eventually to an overwhelming and irresistible uprising of the people in response to extreme state oppression, and the establishment of the Proletarian Revolutionary Utopia. 
In Spain, as applied by ETA, this simply led to 40 years of hopeless violence and hatred, and not the slightest weakening of the Spanish state. Simply a spiral of violence which no one could escape from.
Similarly, the recent  – ill-planned –  Catalan revolt has merely reinforced, even rejuvenated, Spanish nationalism, which is now in full renewed vigour, and propelled the new and truly nationalist/ Falangist (ie Spanish fascist) Citizens’ party to a very strong electoral position, threatening the more reasonable, older, conservative party which is now in trouble.  Everyone now seems locked in to their respective positions and room for negotiation has more or less vanished. 
Magnificent home goals by both ETA and the Catalan nationalists, but at least in Catalonia no on died (partly due to the fact that in the 1970’s the Spanish police were free to kill whom they chose to, but are now more constrained  by international  media, and also of course to the fact that the nationalist Catalans themselves killed no one).

Hi John Michael,
Just out of total curiosity, could you apply the concept of negative evil as a description of humanities relationship with the environment (actually I probably mean the biosphere)? It seems somehow apt to me.
I have to now re-read your essay a few times in order to get to the deeper understanding.
Far out, it is cold here. This winter has felt colder than normal and I have noted that the grass seems to be very slow growing and the wildlife is hungry. Most nights of late a truly ginormous wombat has been happily munching away in the orchard.

Interesting how Fortune and Smuts seem to approach an idea that David Bohm developed – implicate order. As I understand it from Bohm’s book by the same name, and here I am going out on a limb because I am not a physicist, “all” is wrapped up in the implicate “ordering” of the universe. It takes one’s “unraveling” to understand the implications of that order. The unraveling is not a simple process, but one we all go through in learning. Bohm later moved into a philosophy of conversation with Krishnamurti based on that unraveling. I find Bohm fascinating, and a man well before his time. Am I on the right track in understanding Fortune’s approach as one that resembles, at least in some ways, Bohm’s? I do find this work challenging, and your commentaries insightful and “inciteful”.
Peace, Tim

@Stefania I got a really nice loaf of bread at the farmers market yesterday and ate way too much of it, and the only thing that finally stopped me was saying out loud “Bread and Jam for Frances” every time I approached the remaining half loaf! So thank you for saving me from myself! 
I am in the middle of a writing project right now and am experiencing a great deal of negative evil in my own procrastination. The way I try to manage it is to practice scales on the guitar as part of my procrastination so that I get that sweet procrastination thrill but I’m still doing something productive and “real”. But oh, it’s hard. Every time I have a deadline it’s so painful. I know I do it to myself.

This month’s introduction comparing to systems theory has been helpful for me trying to map these concepts onto concrete things where I can use them.
What follows is mostly thoughts about last month’s reading, but I hope it is still relevant enough.
In the first chapter, I couldn’t internalize the description of the unmanifest when I compared it to the popular materialist notions of the universe, and could when I used the lens of JMG’s first Well of Galabes essay “Explaining the World”. It was so much easier that I wonder if it was meant to foreshadow this book club selection.
When the manifest is taken as the world, man-old, what we experience, and unmanifest as unimaginable reality, phrases like “pure being” and “IT alone is substance’” become plain. I do have to twist words like “occurred”, “qualities” and “history” away from their normal usage as absolutes and recognize them as mental representations, but that seems appropriate for a work on magical philosophy.
In this arrangement, our representations would be the ring cosmos, and the “blooming, buzzing” sensations where consciousness contacts the previously unmanifest form the ring chaos.
Sensations can be considered negative evil in the sense they are a manifestation of an indifferent environment we have to struggle against to survive. 
Light and dark, up and down, soft and hard, before and after: Our inner world is made of dualities and their combinations. If something was a unity, constant in time and space, then we could not perceive it. It would not be manifest to us.
I think that’s the main difference the ‘werold’ framing has made for me. Manifestation is about being manifest *to* something. Unmanifest is anything and everything that is inaccessible to the cosmos you are looking from. It’s imagined as empty space because of it’s unknowableness, not for lack of essence. This fits with the second chapter’s discussion of the mutual dependence of ring cosmos and ring chaos for existence. I am going to put more thought into if the details of the second chapter make sense this way.
I admit maybe with this interpretation, which is the most general one that makes sense to me so far, I am taking the cosmology in a narrower sense than what is meant, since there is no mention of a perceiver or consciousness.

When the idea of using evil as a thrust block was presented in the first chapter, I immediately thought of athletes who will compile all the negative press they receive in their lockers and use it as motivation to be great. Combining this notion with magic is still a stumbling block for me, though I think a small one to get past.
Another thing I’ve been thinking about is the notion of opposite, and unequal forces and how that relates to using evil as a thrust block. The notion of giving way to evil to make it go away makes plenty of sense. I think if pest pressure in a garden…or human pressure on a planet ;). Let it go far enough, negative feedback will kick in and bring things into balance. Opposite and unequal to make a change is where I’m not so sure…unless the opposite force is so overwhelmingly more powerful…like an atom bomb. I lean toward using subtle forces…I guess they just take more time for change to unfold. This is a great chapter with much useful concepts. I’m looking forward to more of this discussion and reading and watching it play out in life. Thank you.

Two selections which I ran across today in my reading of _The Mystical Qabalah_, also by DF.
First, not directly relevant to this month’s reading, but cool nonetheless: “The power of the Roman Chur h does not lie in charter, but in function.  It is powerful, not because Peter received the Keys (which he probably didn’t) , but because it knows its job.”  (Chapter 23, paragraph 15)
Second, a bit more directly relevant to the discussion of negative evil and the function of the thrust-block: “We see, then, that it is through inhibitions and refrainings on the lower planes that the dynamic energy of the highest plane is rendered available.  It is in the Sphere of Hod that the rational mind imposes these inhibitions on the dynamic animal nature of the soul; condensing them; formulating them; directing them by limiting them and preventing diffusion.” (Chapter 23, paragraph 24)
The latter, in particular, speaks to the efficacy (even necessity) of limits, Ring Chaos and Ring Pass Not, in our text.

What I’m enjoying most about this experience is how well it synthesizes other topics discussed here. As I understand what Fortune is getting at, the dynamic between the Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos is the ultimate source of what we experience the Law of Flow and Evolution, as discussed in the last text.  Or rather, they are both symbolic ways of talking about the flowing and evolving aspects of our experience.  Put another way, the watery aspects of our experience and reality?
The Ring-Pass-Not, is the symbolic definition of a given system, and can be related to the Law of Systems and the Law of Limits. Sounds rather Saturnine to me!  
I also wonder if we can think of the Ring-Cosmos as the Awen of a given system.  The Ring-Chaos can be a number of things, whether just forces of “Negative Evil” (which reminds me so much of what Simone Weil called Gravity), or even the Awen of another creature, like Spiders and Flies 😀  
Lastly, I see this text could be read as a metaphysical underpinning of the principle of liberty, mentioned recently.  By saying you can pursue what you want to do so long as you don’t harm others, is a way of managing the conflict between each person’s Ring-Cosmos (or Awen?)  If two people are in conflict, their Ring cosmos are opposed to each other, and so enter a relationship like the Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos. The principle of liberty, is a little ‘space’ so the conflict isn’t as bad as it otherwise be.  
Welp, that’s my initial jab at this stuff….

Let me see if I understand Fortune’s writing by trying to put it into a modern political context.
—–
The currently dominant system of political economy, neoliberalism, has the following values:
Markets are supposed to be open to capital flows, trade in goods and services, and labor across international borders. Tariffs and capital controls should be virtually nonexistent, and borders should be as close to open as the native population of a country will tolerate. 
Taxes should be fairly low on the rich, who may make use of tax havens to park their money. Regulations, where they exist, should be written to benefit corporations and the accumulation of capital. The government should pretend to be laissez-faire but in reality intervene actively to help corporate actors, such as by bailing them out if they blow an enormous bubble and crash the financial system. 
Politicians should be elected, but all serious candidates are supposed to agree on the general neoliberal model, and elections should be contested primarily on social issues and other topics that do not affect the structure of the economy. Economic issues, where present, should be restricted to fairly minor details and adjustments – no politician should question the overall structure.
On international affairs, the United States is supposed to handle the task of policing the global empire. It may intervene at will if a nation is behaving inconveniently, using whatever combination of withholding foreign aid, instigating of “color revolutions”, economic sanctions, airstrikes, covert ops, and outright invasion it deems necessary to keep insubordinate nations in line. Human rights are to be the rhetorical fig leaf of choice. The task of managing Europe is left to the EU, which is to provide the carrots and sticks required to keep all its countries behaving in the most convenient possible manner for capital, particularly that of Germany, France, and smaller “core” countries.
—–
Political actors who support these stances are operating in the plane of the Ring-Cosmos of the current international order. Examples include virtually all Western political leaders of the 1980s, 90s, 00s, and early 2010s, including Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr., and Obama; Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown, and Cameron; and so on. By acting to sustain it, they are good for neoliberalism.
Lately, forces of negative evil have arrived, unintentionally summoned by the excess of good. The most popular label to describe negative evil wrt neoliberalism is “populist”. Despite a variety of differences, everyone called populist is acting to challenge and undermine the existing neoliberal system, and this is what they have in common. There are right-wing populists such as Trump, Farage, Johnson, Le Pen, Wilders, Salvini, Orban, Kaczynski, and Putin. There are also left-wing populists such as Sanders, Corbyn, Melenchon, Iglesias, Di Maio, Tsipras, Chavez, Maduro, Morales, and both Kirchners. They all share a belief that the neoliberal system is not benefiting their people. To that end, they withdraw from or weaken trade agreements and international organizations, reimpose tariffs and other barriers, tighten border controls (more popular on the right), improve social safety nets and other services (more popular on the left), and so on. All of these policies are aligned with the Ring-Chaos and act to dissolve our current system of political economy.
One of the main differences between modern populists and the Nazis is that the populists are forces of negative evil – they are acting to dissolve the current system, and mostly not to create their own coherent cosmos in which the new Ring-Cosmos is aligned closely with the current system’s Ring-Chaos. That would be positive evil. Negative evil simply acts to push a system toward dissolution. (I am nowhere near sure I understand this correctly)
Modern populists are greatly strengthened by the opposition they have received. Trump is the most spectacular example – if his campaign had been met with crickets from the media and other influential “good” actors, he would have been flung to the Ring-Pass-Not and gone away very rapidly. Instead, he was met with widespread denunciation and $2 billion of overwhelmingly negative media coverage. Knowing it strengths him, he behaves in a manner calculated to cause as much bad publicity as possible. The result is that he dominates news coverage every single day, strengthening even further. He will continue to be politically successful until the Dems figure out that denouncing him makes him stronger and that they have to instead run with compelling positive messages, rather than just opposing him. 
(The message need not have much content. Their most recent success ran with empty slogans emphasizing “hope” and “Change We Can Believe In”. The crucial part was that he portrayed himself as a positive alternative to Bushism, not that his marketing campaign had any real substance.)
—–
How well did I do? Was this a reasonably accurate interpretation of Fortune’s concepts as applied to modern political economy, or do I have significant misunderstandings?

Hello JMG,
Quick question with regards to your post.. you mentioned that it is very common for groups or individuals to assume the are aligned with angelic forces or Ring-Cosmos, but that they’ve never bothered to check if that’s the case. How do you check?

How does one discern between something on the Ring of Chaos vs. something that I don’t like/approve of? This is what comes to mind – the other day a post on a website that was pro-pedophilia with the slogan “Love Knows No Age”. When I think of pedophilia, my next though is “I wish the sentence was stoning because I would join in!” It disgusts and angers me, and I see it as evil. Obviously not everyone sees it that way and there’s a group of people who derive great pleasure from sex with children. 
The normal human tendency is to make a statement pro or against and then start trying to get agreement. “I think this is evil and here’s why, don’t you agree?” This can make one feel better about how one feels, but it doesn’t accomplish anything in physical reality. Here’s a group of people who think X is evil and talk about it, but X is still evil and doing whatever X is doing.
Is this where the part she say “hate must be confronted with hate” comes in?
I didn’t read through the comments before posting so apologies in advance if this is a repeat question.

“Resistance causes persistance” – oh my gosh, I’m snorting with laughter thinking of all those #resistance hashtags on Twitter. The opposing side sometimes uses #persistance hashtags and all of it props Trump up. 
OMG No wonder he doesn’t get upset or flustered by the constant complaining! I’ve been thinking how can one man deal with this constant criticism and insults when his predecessor got nothing but praise. Now I get it! The continued loud #resistance is fueling him! It makes Trump persist and what he is doing grow. 
My brain is so trained to be afraid of someone disagreeing with me and confronting me in public. Too many years in classrooms! I’ve heard people say “when people start publicly disagreeing with you, then you know you are getting somewhere”, and I thought “yes, that is logical but it is also scary and uncomfortable”. Now I see that spinning of the wheel, so to speak, is what kicks off an effective change out in physical reality. Brilliant!

Re: “actions” and “reactions”, to Xabier
Of course, after and action there is a reaction, for example in Catalonia, the Citizens’ Party (Partido Cuidadanos) was born in Catalonia and the leadership (the “Caudillo” for you) is catalan, as you said they are Falangistas (Spanish fascists) because:
a) As the falangistas, they want to abolish democracy
b) As the old Falange, they want to ban all the parties, except Cuidadanos
c) They want to take the power by violent means (patriotic revolution or military coup d’etat) as Falange
d) They have an armed paramilitary force that hit and assault leftist and separatist frequently, as good falangistas did
e) They are against liberalism, and have an agenda of autarchy and isolationism as the falangistas did
f) They go to the Valle de los Caidos to praise Franco and José Antonio with the roman salute
Of course the Ciudadanos party have none of those attributes of a real fascist party, but for you it does not matter at all
The catalonian separatists use the same strategies with the voters of Ciudadanos party in Spain that the left in USA with the voters of Trump: both must be fascists, reactionaries, backwardist, totalitarians, supremacists, etc…. All of this is just a mixture of straw-man-ism and thought-stopper-ism, as our host has talked in the past, and the results (“reaction”) of this strategy will be the same in both sides of the pond
I do not want to bore people with the Spanish politics, and also it is not the topic of this week, but another day I would like to talk about the slogan “Espanya ens roba” (Spain rob us) and the real “reasons” for the Catalonian crisis (or “Roma Ladrona” in the case of the Lombardy crisis)

@Saradee
Thanks for your comment.  We each translate the text according to our personal experience, habits, convictions etc., or in the analogy being used, our location and direction of movement. Those are our starting points. For instance your translation of the phrase in question “You must hate the hate with sufficient force to lock it up…”, sounds like a recipe for a “pinball existence” from where I sit. Let’s just say I’m more selective with what I choose to hate. I have no reason to assume I’m correct in my approach, but it appears that you may be confusing “dislike” for “hate”. If I unholstered my colt at every dislike … or defined myself by what I refuse, I’d rapidly reduce my existence to a tiny cage. Or, as someone said to me once … its very difficult to hug a hedgehog.
The way I see this exercise is that its value for me will be measured by the degree to which I let the major rings alter my direction of movement into greater alignment with purpose; in other words how much I will grow as a result of the exercise. I’ve noticed my mind’s discomfort with resting in the unformed of giant spinning circles of unmanifest space, and its desire to congeal the forces into concepts I can relate to.  In doing so, it tends to reveal its customary ruts, and patterns, as much as valuable breakthroughs. The point in returning to the text is to suspend judgment, re-attune to the basic words/images, and see what changes unfold. 
Posting comments here is for my own benefit – like page-marks in the book of my process.  The point is not to score brownie points, but to release that thought, and make space for something new.  Whether my words happen to piss you off, uplift you, or leave you stone cold is not really my concern.  But I wish you well.

* Notice how the soi-disant “Resistance” is purely reactive — they’ve basically stopped trying to do anything but stop Trump. They have become his Ring-Chaos, the thrust block from which he gains traction. *
OK, I’m trying to understand the concepts with a practical example, and I suppose Trump and the Resistance is as good an example as any. So if the Resistance is Trump’s Ring-Chaos, what is the Ring Cosmos here? Is it Trump? And what is the Ring Pass-Not?

Firstly, this is really helping me understand the principles and practical application underlying the laws of balance and limits.  Secondly, it’s giving me some better insight into a phenomenon that has shaped much of my experience.  All of my life I’ve bounced between a strong desire to do things in the world, and then recoiling in response to various fears and anxieties that arise inside me.  My make up includes a strong will to live and accomplish things, combined with a sensitive nervous system and bouncy mind which generates a good amount of anxiety.  So I might decide to do something in the world, and after some time thinking and planning I feel a wave of anxiety and uncertainty which can dissipate my commitment. The relationship between these two forces, my will to live and fear/uncertainty shapes my cosmos, day to day. 
As I’ve come to understand this about myself I can see I have basically two ways of handling it, which correspond to DF’s two thoughts on how to handle “negative evil”.  Often, when faced with nervousness or uncertainty, I simply decide to push against it, and go ahead anyway, almost defying it with my will. Psychologists call this counter-phobic behavior.  I completely get what DF is talking about, in terms of using the anxiety as a thrust-block, defying it almost, kicking against it to get something done.  It does provide a certain type of fuel for my actions, but it also locks the anxiety in place, so that I’m almost surfing along on anxiety as I do what I do.  It’s a powerful force, but it doesn’t feel comfortable at all.  It can be exhausting ultimately.  The other way, which I think corresponds to DF’s idea of treating “hate with hate” is to just acknowledge the fear, be completely aware of it, but allow it to be there as I do what I do, not fighting it. Letting it be.   And I find that the sense of fear dissipates or dissolves by itself when I do that, which is good; but it also makes me feel a lot more mellow and calm, and so I don’t always get as much done when I’m in this more allowing or accepting state.  I’m 57, and it’s taken me most of my life to figure this out about myself – this chapter of the Cosmic Doctrine is really helping to clarify it all. Hopefully I am not building a firm grasp of the wrong end of the stick?

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. For every motion there is an opposition of unequal forces. For every thing there is a stalemate of equal and opposed forces.
So oppose (negative) evil to create a stable thing, because that thing is a stalemate of force from the ring chaos and the ring cosmos it is not over determined as a contribution of evolution or to dissolution. It does how ever lock up the forces that found balance in that thing; those forces, being locked up, can no longer be free to participate in either ring with out a surplus force from one of the rings. If there is a surplus of force in the ring cosmos it can be used to found a motion toward the rings further evolution. In addition to that it becomes like a sail to the winds of the ring chaos. This is behind catabolis; that which has accumulated in the building up of the stairway to heaven is now an additional susceptibility to chaos. That which is created (by opposing evil to stalemate) then requires upkeep to continue using it; force which is no longer available to build up further. By opposing evil when the surplus of energy is lacking one creates a wound that bleeds out life force toward the outer region of the ring of pass not, and the powers of evil redouble acting on each reaction. Thereby creation causes the preconditions for destruction. In destruction the sails of the winds of chaos are shredded, and those winds can find no purchase, the evil goes unopposed to the Oort cloud of the system along side the parts which were destroyed; the essential desire of the ring cosmic condenses in a spin (like a figure skater) and begins a cycle again. As not all things (which remember are a stalemate of equal and opposed forces) are the same in their susceptibility to the winds of chaos, nor are they equal in their functionality as steps in the stair case to the heaven of that ring cosmic; the golden core of the sun of that system, the Logos; nor are they equal in their effect upon other things in the system, their complex of alignment to the other rings with in the cosmos. Thus as the cycle repeats, it tweaks, such that the beats of the tempo of a cosmos rhymes more than it repeats. The exploration of this rhyme scheme is the poetry of the rings.
For the sort of cosmos that a human being might be and the freedoms and limits common to such cosmoses, a powerful freedom is the (limited) freedom to choose what evils to face with the courage of creation, and there by to build of the complication of the system; and what evils to be serene before, and there by to allow the evil to drag away to the outer realms that which is not long for the inner system; also what evils to contemplate, and what evils to ignore. 
The tighter into the cosmos things (as defined above) build, the deeper into the cosmos the forces of evil may blow; and as those forces are pulled inward to the depths of the cosmos they take on the character of that which is deeply cosmic (as opposed to deeply chaotic) and thus negative evil in time gives way to positive evil; and yet the basic nature remains so similar, but now the positive evil is possessed of cunning such that in can not longer be treated as a simple wind -spirit- which animates it; as its understanding takes on the character of the cosmos it partakes in. 
It is no wonder that The Faustian Cosmos has been so fantastically creative, and has accumulated such a surplus or artifacts compared to all its peers, considering that its relation to evil was so strongly influenced by the mentorship of St. George.
“Things” as I have defined them for the thought experiment above, are there for not not chaos, and not cosmic; and not without chaos, nor with out cosmic order. They are cosmoi in their own right. To oppose evil creates a stalemate, such that a cosmic and chaotic current entwine in a ringsystem; yet the stalemate is never set on perfectly balanced terms, there are always fluctuations in it so satisfy the preconditions of motion (opposition of inequal forces). Thus things are possessed of their own life, a share of the force spend in their host cosmos’ act of opposition (creation). If they are created by a preponderance of the good, then they will be created such that their own rings are aligned with the rings of their system, like Jupiter ( 82 degrees tilt).
By opposing evil you create. If you create that which is off kilter to your cosmos you create a foundation of sand, and you pre-doom that which you build upon it to be eroded by evil, unless continually subsidized by energy from the greater system, but that subsidy is obviously bought at the expense of where else in might be better spent .

Scotlyn, good. What is Fortune implying by reversing what seem like the obvious relationships of spirit and matter to the Rings? 
Pogonip, you’d win that bet hands down. 
Leo, yes, that’s one workable way to think about the Rings. 
Justin, it certainly worked for me. 
Phil H., good. The text will be talking about the origin of nondeterministic phenomena a little later on. 
Mailinglists, that’s a useful habit! Another thing you can do is, as you read through the text, see if there are specific sentences that stand out to you, either as summarizing things clearly or as raising questions you want to explore more deeply. 
Marco, if you’ve got a visual imagination, painting would likely be a very good way to work with inner conflicts — I know Jung used to encourage his patients to do that. Me, I think entirely in spoken language, and I’d have no idea what to paint. 
David, I get that. The universe is serenely uninterested in our opinions of what matters, of course — though it’s often in the course of wrestling with these unwanted necessities, trying to do something besides the one thing that has to be done, that insight is born. 
Phil K., good. Very good. 
Docshibby, I like that! You’re right, of course — the chaos of chattering thoughts becomes the thrust block against which you build focus in meditation. 
Kimberly, there’s a trap in the notion of locking up force by opposition; you really do have to have more force than the other side, or you’re the one that gets locked up. That’s what’s happening to the Resistance. Trump tweets something, his enemies go into one of their shrieking hatefests, and while they’re frozen in that reactive posture, he builds on top of that. They assume that Trump hates them, because that’s how they justify the hatred and rage they fling at Trump — but have you noticed that when he walks past a bunch of protesters, he’s usually grinning? He doesn’t hate them at all; he knows that he can make them do whatever he wants them to do, simply by tweeting something at them..and they keep on falling for it. Every. Single. Time. 
But you’re also right that Trump’s opponents love their own hatred. After all those years subject to the tyranny of mandatory niceness, they can hate right out there in public to their heart’s content — and they owe that to Trump. My working guess is that the Democrats will nominate someone unelectable in 2020, just so they can have four more years of wallowing ecstatically in hatred. 
Violet, good question. I don’t know why the War against the Red Enemy is so central to the American psyche; I’ve just been struck by the fact that it is. 
Dylan, seems sensible to me. I don’t follow Peterson so don’t have a clear sense of what he’s up to; it sounds from what you’ve said that he’s into what Toynbee call archaicism — the idea that a civilization in crisis can rescue itself by going back to the “Good Old Days” in some, usually moral sense. But I’m not at all sure how to fit that into the Cos. Doc. 
Tripp, that certainly makes sense to me. 
Scotlyn, you’re most welcome! 
Danae, when the oracle at Delphi said that Socrates was the wisest man in Greece, he responded to the news by saying that it was because he knew that he knew nothing, while everyone else thought mistakenly that they knew something. So you may be getting wise…
Tripp, no, you’re on to something. I’ve been reading a book on Christian meditation — fascinating, but not one I’d recommend — and the author makes it clear that to him, and to other Christian meditators, when they go into meditation there’s the power of evil sitting right there reaching for them. Meditators who aren’t Christians don’t experience that at all, as far as my experience extends  (and I’ve taught a lot of people to meditate). So something in Christian belief or practice is quite literally constellating the power of evil and bringing it into manifestation, in a way that other people (even other devoutly religious people with a strict code of morality) don’t experience at all. 
Kay, excellent. Yes, we could have dealt with the 9/11 attacks the way most nations deal with terrorist outrages — in a measured, unflustered way — and the whole thing would have blown past. Instead, we convinced every terrorist on the planet that blowing up Americans is a great way to generate a vast overreaction. 
Christopher, you’ve mostly got it. The Ring-Chaos isn’t the Unmanifest — it’s another spinning ring of moving space — but for those inside a cosmos, it expresses the Unmanifest and leads toward the Unmanifest. Think of it as the Unmanifest’s doorman!
Bonnie, excellent. Remember you can also treat emotions as you would any other force; you can lock them up by opposition and build on them, or you can create a vacuum around them and let them follow their bliss to the Ring-Pass-Not and dissolution. 
Ray, a fine meditation! The extension of the center is something we’ll get into in a later chapter, in quite a bit of detail. 
Xabier, a lot of radicals in the US in the late 1960s and early 1970s made exactly the same mistake, and helped the system stabilize itself in reaction to their activities. It’s an old source of failure, very frequently practiced.

Re: the insightful comment by Stefania about the childrens’ book, BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES:

I admire the charming BREAD AND JAM very much, but I had never heard it described as “occult literature.” Is there more to say about that? 
(My own favorite part is the veal cutlets scene, where Frances asks her father (to the best of my recollection), “Where do veal cutlets come from?” And he mildly answers, “We can talk about that later. Now it is time for you to go to bed.”)

Getting personal at last.
I have done several meditations on this material, its fantastically playful and interesting mindscape to explore, even in my map is as yet stained with an unknown level of misrepresentations of DF’s thinking, its good enough to have a very fun time exploring.
I have been stressed for the last couple months. Its happens generally in the summer, as I like to be free to follow my bliss in the winter, it means that I got to squirrel a way big time all summer to afford that; balance. It is more than this, a little less than half of my work actually makes me any profit in the sense of assets that I can use to follow my bliss in the winter and do my part as a pillar for my kin and kith (which is the meaning of profits for my ends). In addition to those projects are numerous projects, either my own or following a friend’s lead, most of which pay me only in satisfied curiosity, but which collectively draw from me more energy than I can realistically afford, with out taking energy from systems that can ill afford the cuts.
There are various evils, most of which are popular topics to Green Wizards at large, which draw my attention, and I choose to react to. Having reacted it becomes a “thing” in my life. So many things.
There is a general evil in my life, aging. At 30 I can notice a few hints at its course, most importantly by constitution which use to be health eating any thing that can fit in my mouth, now leaves me feeling very blah if I am reckless in my diet. This evil of a diet which is accelerating my dissolution, seems to be a priority to respond to. Aging also acts upon my life indirectly. My parents are nearing 70, and aging has been hitting them pretty hard the last few years. Since my parents being dragged out of the this life by way of wretched poverty isn’t an evil I am particularly inclined to treat serenely, I am gradually taking on more responsibility about providing a basic living for them… in fact this is the main cost that the above mentioned squirreling pays.
The nitty gritty of that opposition. My parents can no longer afford the way of life they are use to. Either the capacity to work full time, or the energy to do for themselves certain things they once did. This intersects with my own issue of diet in a most frustrating way. My Mom hasn’t the energy to get out of the house more than a couple times a week, and she does what she can to cook for the family. But, mentally she has difficulty doing things outside of long earned habit. Furthermore my Dad is ever less adventurous to eat new things. This means that there is an abundance of white bread, cheese like dairy product, sweets, and industrial meats in the house; each of which are proving to present challenges for me beyond mindful servings. Because my main income source is working harvest for a friend’s organic market garden, I have an arbitrarily large supply of veggie ‘seconds’ and various other fresh local foods. Aging deprives my family of the energy to know what to do with exotic produce like kettice, cabbage, squash, or carrots, and I work too long to cook family meals at the time they are used to eating. This leads to conflict, where I come home hungry and tired to a set table of plates full of delicious food which, if eaten, will leave me feeling weak, wretched, and resentful for hours. Commenting on how this is an unwelcome situation for me leads to tantrums on my Mom’s part which are very tiring to endure, if I am not exceedingly careful with timing and wording; regardless of timing and wording the situation repeats.
It is interesting that the white bread, cheese, and meat diet costs many times more than I have ever spent on groceries; yet cost is raised as an objection to my habit of eating local meat and veggies, even when I consistently get them for between free and half market price. A $20 3 pound roast bought at $10 becomes an oft repeated stock story of absurdly high  costs, the comparison of the $45 dollar pizza night must not be made; nor the hours of itis that followed the pizza. Particularly sad is contrast of the memory of my parents toughness, adaptability, and resiliency decades ago when I was a child.
Well, venting aside, I am determined to provide what support I can for my family, even if the evils of aging will in time mercifully render the effort mute; and I am determined to improve my diet and general health, even if the evil of aging will in time (hopefully a longer time) bring that effort too to a merciful end. These two struggles are very tied up together, because doing the first is made vastly more efficient by living at home during the work season for market farming; so that I can pay my rent and their rent in one fell swoop. Since I am fixed on opposing these evils it follows that I had ought to do so with a preponderance of energy; that the patterns built upon that effort doesn’t sync up with chaos, but instead such that the patterns thereby built are wholesome and cosmic; such these particular struggles end, they leave behind something good.
Suppose, for the sake of consideration, rising halfheartedly to this challenge. It creates a perfect environment for the foibles of my parents to pass down into me, such that my own patterns of health decline down the steeper section of the same slope as theirs, my heart accruing resentment all the way. If, however, I maintain the primary fronts of the struggle (diet and family duty), but exhaust myself on the flanks, other conflicts with evil I have engaged in become losing battles, spawning chaotic storms.
Since there is only a limited fraction of the energy in my life which I have conscious freedom to control, then in order to not be overwhelmed I have to be more thrifty about its expenditure into conflicts with negative evil. Fortunately there is a particular negative evil I have been struggling with for years, investing a vast amount of energy, which I can afford to decrease my energy investment in by several hours a week. That negative evil is the Green Wizard concern of the unsustainable agriculture, market garden techniques as dependent on plastic as conventional growers are on sprays; the dying of traditions of growing staple foods with out machines to break to soil, till, or harvest. I threw a huge amount of energy toward growing an acre this year, with over 100 seed lines from over 60 species, to weigh in against that evil, but the battle was a rout; as herbicide had contaminated the soil, undetected from years past, and destroyed such a fraction of the crop that no profits can be made from the effort, excepting a few survivors. In an era of catabolic collapse such struggles are often like a sad battle in middle earth, as the momentum of time is against the building of new things, and for the dissolution of things which can not longer be sustained. Though there is merit in a long defeat over a quick defeat in times of decline; maybe there are differences in the applications of DF’s logic between eras defined by progress and those colored with decline. 
By changing my terms of engagement with this battle of Green Wizardry I think I can conserve considerable energy for protecting core functions (the battles I thematically described in terms of aging). For instance, since my way to acquire currency is to work for other farmers who are more talented business folk that I am (being more the mad wizard type myself) I can affect cheap wins in green Wizardry by way of minor refinements to functional gardens (that I work for, but ain’t the person where the buck stops) owned and operated by not-me. I can reduce the labor of my own personal garden by switching to growing a smaller number of highly labor effective crops; indian corn, sun flowers, winter squash, dry beans; by ditching my super jankey sprinkler system for simple ditch irrigation techniques I was learned on this year; by letting the weedy low area go feral; by accepting the help of my friends tractor for a couple time consuming tasks, satisfied that we know how to change tactics when the time comes that the evil of ‘affording to keep the tractor running’ out grows the evil of ‘having time to dig umpteem ditches.’ Fight the lesser of optional evils, that you have the preponderance of energy to rightly face the evils you can not so easily opt out of facing. I can save this energy, because I know how to use the techniques I have not the time for on large scale, and need not invest the energy again and again at full scale to prove it to myself again and again. A much smaller ‘purist’ garden, a fiftieth the size, is enough to keep the techniques evolving, at a much more affordable investment of energy. 
Then redirect that energy into cooking for my family more often, because they are keen to eat free vegetable food, and long as they don’t have to learn how to cook it. Thus saving energy by not fighting the evil of “lunch meat is expensive compared to lentils.”
In fact, I could go through many details, where Green Wizardry is tempting to treat as an accumulation of ‘cool sustainable projects, skills, tools, and resources’ and rephrase it in terms of things evils (costs mostly) that I can let go of with as much grace as possible. The greatest win I have had in Green Wizardry is learning to use an electric bike and trailer to accomplish the tasks that pickup trucks are used for; at about 1/20 the cost per operational mile.

Quin,
No, I wasn’t aware that Russell Hoban also wrote occult literature for adults!  I was joking around for the most part, although the story just seemed to be a really good example of how to deal with negative evil by letting it dissipate.  It all makes perfect sense now, though – of course he must have read the Cos Doc!
Aron Blue,
That is too funny…I tend to do that with bread from the farmer’s market too.  I’ll have to keep Frances in mind next time.
And incidentally, I was also thinking about deadlines in the context of the CosDoc.  I usually feel that unless I have a deadline, the work to be done can be endlessly put off to the point where it never gets done.  I guess for me having a deadline acts as a bit of a thrust block!

@Marco – indeed we all interpret through our own viewpoints and preconceptions. I must be getting something wrong in my interpretation of Dion perhaps, as your interpretation of what I meant is about 180 degrees from what I thought I was saying! Turn around your idea about what you thought I was advocating for 180 degrees and see if we understand each other better 😉

One idea that has been coming up for me, not explicitly mentioned in the text but implied by it (at least to me), is that according to occult philosophy we humans have some powers of creation, as the Microcosm to the Macrocosm.  Although we don’t know what force actually created the first Manifestation in an Unmanifest where by definition nothing happens, my best guess makes it somehow a product of thought and will. Like a vector with both magnitude and direction.  So when I pay attention to something, my will to think about it and my thought about it makes it real in my Ring Cosmos.   If that is the case, then what I think about, I create, even if I think about it in opposition or negatively.  For example, in an argument with someone, if I engage with them even in opposition, I’m essentially agreeing with them that yes, I see the thing that they’re talking about is real and exists.  So we end up stuck on the same coin, just on different sides.  Good becomes locked up with evil in that way – once I engage with evil, I attract and bind it to myself, and then I’m stuck with it.  It takes a certain amount of power or an abundance of good as Dion says to escape from the binary of simply trying to oppose evil.  The Ring Chaos exerts a force on my Ring Cosmos and I’m stuck.  The thought occurred that I somehow need to reach ‘escape velocity’ through building up occult power or abundance of good, an abundance of will moving in some other direction.  Then I can engage with evil without merely getting stuck to it.
Let’s say someone is sick.  And they decide to tackle it by opposing this negative evil (which moves counter to their Ring-Cosmos of being healthy).  So they try to do everything they can to be healthy – eat well, exercise, meditate, whatever occurs to them to do.  But why are they doing all of these things?  Because they’re…sick, of course.  So their creative power of doing what they want with their life has become locked up with the evil – they’re spending all their energy trying to fight the evil and thus can’t do anything else.  With this idea of humans having creative power, it would also send a message to their Cosmos that they’re sick,  and thus their world gets created and locked into place in that way.  As you said, ‘what you resist, persists.’  So sickness and health are also just two sides of the same coin.  To truly be well or balanced, one would need to stop thinking about one’s self in terms of that binary of sickness/health – one would need to somehow get off the coin.

Chris, indeed you could. The future of industrial society is a good example of how a force moving parallel to the Ring-Chaos follows its trajectory out to the edge of existence, and dissolves. 
Timothy, implicate order is a central concept in systems theory, as I’m sure you’re aware, and Bohm’s development of it is well worth close study. Yes, what Fortune is talking about in these chapters is the genesis of implicate order, and in chapters to come we’ll be talking about how the implicate order is explicated over time. 
Kalek, good! I didn’t intentionally model that essay on the Cos. Doc., but I’ve been studying Fortune’s work for quite a few decades, so it’s not at all surprising that there should be echoes. Yes, your analysis works well. 
Mike, that’s a great example. Thank you. 
David, true enough. 
JMA, a good initial jab! 
Grebulocities, that’s pretty good. The one thing I’d suggest is that Trump et al. do actually have a coherent policy in mind, a Ring-Cosmos of their own; it’s not at right angles to the Ring-Cosmos of neoliberalism, even though the “Resistance” insists that it is; but Trump realizes that the first requirement is to dissolve crucial elements of the existing order (free trade, open borders, and the US as the world’s policeman) so that his alternative has room to take shape. 
EcMike, that’s the number one question in the philosophy of ethics, and there’s no simple touchstone. One good indicator, though, is that if the things you’re doing are things you’d denounce the other side for doing, you’re probably not on the side of the angels. 
Grandmother, here again, that’s one of the classic questions in the philosophy of ethics, and there are no easy answers. As for “resistance causes persistence,” bingo; have you noticed that I sometimes deliberately court opposition in my writings, because it allows me to get things done I wouldn’t otherwise be able to do? 
Maria R, I’m glad to hear you’re trying to understand! Note that I specified in that comment that what’s being discussed is Donald Trump’s own Ring-Cosmos, the pattern of things he’s doing and trying to bring about in the world. The Resistance also has its Ring-Cosmos, and just at the moment his Ring and theirs are at right angles. The question then becomes which of them is stronger and more clever, because whoever loses that contest is simply going to become a thrust block to the other. The Ring-Pass-Not defines the boundary of the interaction between them; think of it as the boundary around the whole range of issues about which they disagree. 
Mark, not at all — it sounds as though you’ve grasped the core of what Fortune is trying to say. 
Ray, another solid meditation.

@Stefania, re: deadlines: It absolutely works that way for me!
Also, most of my published writing has been the result of some external imposition: the first book was the result of, essentially, a drunken bet with a friend, while the two trilogies that followed were suggestions from my editors, and the one I’m working on now is the result of a lot of back-and-forth and discarding of initial ideas. Oddly, doing projects that way seems to stretch my mind–and makes the all-my-own projects all the more exciting to write, since it means I have a long time for ideas to percolate there.
So building upon…well, constraint, at least. It’s interesting to me that Nauthiz has stood, in readings, for constraint, hardship, need, and necessity at different times; there’s a complex interrelationship there, I think, unless that’s just the gin and tonic talking.

Stefania, excellent! You get this evening’s gold star for the metaphor of the coin.

If you want to do something genuinely different you have to leave both sides of the opposition.

Mr Greer,
“what Toynbee call archaicism” was the phrase you used to describe the way Dylan interpreted Mr Peterson’s approach to righting the wrongs with the world. Probably accurate, as far as I know. I did not sense any derision, nor judgement, in your statement. It appears to be just how you see it. So now let’s look at the Green Wizard take on things. Going back to a less expensive (in energy terms and more) form of tech is quite desirable, if I read the ideas correctly. I agree, by the way, and I am a farmer. I do not think of the Green Wizards as going back to the “good old days” nor do I sense that from Mr Peterson. In the former it’s more of an issue of keeping the scythe sharp and in the latter being careful to say what you really mean (be precise in your speech).  Both of you would agree: think clearly.
I bring this up only to express my view that you and Mr Peterson are currently bringing a lot of new and positive ideas to my life. I’m quite grateful for all of it with one exception; I’m a bit old for all this work. (I know, sniveling.) I’m just past the “three score and ten” age and I wish I had a bit (what the heck does that mean?) more time to put all of this into practice. I’m very aware that making changes to the thoughts, and consequently, the life I live takes some large amounts of time. It’s a slow process. I’m reminded of my first class in the religions of the far East from college in the late 60s where my professor stated in his first lecture that “life is an abrasive process that ultimately grinds off all of the sharp edges” and leaves one enlightened.  I still have a few of those edges. However, I do laugh a lot. 
Many thanks for all you do.
Best wishes, Aged Spirit

Thanks SaraDee, David, JMG and others for your insights.  I don’t feel any esoteric, occulted subject is beyond my understanding because some of the oddest and wooliest ones have been thoroughly explained with down-to-earth, working examples.  For this brilliance I cannot thank you all enough.  It is life changing.
One quick fly-by example of the Rings: diets.  The Ring-Cosmos is the individual’s desire to lose weight.  The implementation of a diet is Ring-Chaos.  It masquerades as a helper but will act in every single way to sabotage the individual’s efforts.  The human mind has a perverse way of turning on itself when it comes to limiting food, especially in times of plenty. 
A thought on Red Dread as mentioned by JMG in response to Violet.  Might it have something to do with hatred of the feminine in the form of menstrual taboo?  If red triggers the American patriot’s biophobia, I am suggesting it may lurk in the collective subconscious as a period stain.

FWIW I tried meditating once after converting to Catholicism 30 years ago. I was reading Chesterson and Augustine in my free time. I had a boyfriend at the time who was into Hinduism and he meditated so I gave it a whirl. Shortly after calming my mind next to me appeared a huge creature with scales on two legs snarling like rabid dog. I immediately jumped up and ran out of the house waving my arms trying to get it off me. I was so scared. I can still picture this thing in my mind.
I’ve shared this with other people over the years and they told me they never heard of such a thing. I haven’t really tried to meditate since unless I’m in a room of other people and its part of something else, like my martial arts classes. I’ll do walking meditation outside or something inside with my hands like peeling potatoes when I have a 10 pound bag to do. 
I relieved to know someone else experienced this even if I’m hearing about it third hand.

@Helix I spent 3 years in the Peace Corps in the early 1990’s and I can relate to that feeling of stranger in one’s own land. I am still repulsed by parking lots, electric lines running everywhere, and manicured lawns. 
I could have stayed overseas my whole adult life, and there are several PC friends who did just that. It was easier to be a stranger in a strange place than a stranger in a place I grew up in.
One day I thought about how we are all made of atoms spinning around. Then how everything I see and touch is also made of atoms spinning. And the space between everything is atoms spinning. So I say where one thing ends and another begins. This is me – this is a glass with water – this is a table – this is a computer. But its all connected and spinning in constant motion.
I say I am a stranger than I am a stranger. Calling me that allows me to step back and not be a part of community. I can sit in the stands and watch, and criticize, or cheer what others are doing. 
Thinking everyone I meet is spinning atoms and we are made the same stuff, just labeling ourselves and others. So what about how I feel or what I call something? Its something the spinning atoms created and can be turned into something else.

I did notice you put out challenging ideas but honestly I thought you were doing it sometimes to thin the pack of commenters or to fine tune your audience to those who “really get it”. Of course that hasn’t happened in reality; it looks like the number of commenters and readers has gone up steadily and not down!
I did notice that for some commenters who are constantly on one topic, the idea that all Boomers are evil comes to mind immediately, you let the comments pass through without addressing them. You do that a lot actually, not ignoring per se, but focusing on that part of the comments that furthers the conversation you are trying to have.

Are we in the midst of a battle for the future of this country – will it stick to its constitutional roots or turn into a social justice/socialist new place – or is it just me feeling it? I’m not trying to build an agreed reality here – I can certainly find a community online or in the real world that feels this battle and is fighting it – I’m just trying to figure out in the midst of the Cosmic Doctrine, is it happening? It just feels so out of balance and everything is political now. Just yesterday a neighbor friend and I were catching up and we each say how crazy things have gotten. However I realize she thinks its crazy because Trump is destroying the country, imprisoning families for no reason, and trying to supreme leader, and I think its crazy because there are mobs of people trying to force people to think all one way (we visited a campus with all social justice signage everywhere and I asked the administration about it and was told they kick Trump supporters off campus – students, speakers and faculty).  I now can’t talk to her like I used to because honestly I feel like I’m talking with a dementia patient. 
I rationally know from reading you that this is what happens in the decline, and there’s going to be more of it likely, not less, so buckle up. Now I feel like I can’t just sit it out and ignore it. It feels sometimes like things are coming to a head and we aren’t finding common ground like we used to. 
So I guess I have to act based on the reality I see? Not all of us see the same things obviously. Its just scary and I’m worried about so much. Honestly the peak oil issue was easier for me to handle. Living low-energy was rational and I could take specific steps. This now feels like a battle of religions or beliefs and just so emotional.

On an abstract level, what Fortune describes in this chapter is easy enough to grasp, but when I try to apply it to specifics, it becomes clear where my understanding is actually weak. In the end though, all the specific scenarios I have wrestled with brought me back to the idea that for most of the evils in our daily lives, “resist[ing] not evil” looks a bit like New Thought’s positive thinking or the Law of Attraction. It galls me a little to say that because the popular manifestations of those are so tacky. But the way Fortune describes negative evil, it sounds like you can either oppose it (understanding you will never defeat or eliminate it) while focusing on what you will build using evil as a thrust block; or you can accept that it will do its thing and appreciate its “scavenging” action. Sometimes you want things to decay (“Buzzards gotta eat, same as worms,” quoth Josey Wales). Whereas if you focus on the evilness of the evil and how horrible it is, you just entangle yourself with it more and more. Arguably you might even become part of it.
For those familiar with the Yijing/I Ching, Fortune’s explanation of negative evil deepened my understanding of Hexagram 36 (sometimes translated as “Darkening of the Light” or “Brightness Hidden”) tremendously. The traditional text for the hexagram relates to the story of Prince Ji: Living among a dissolute court, Ji, as a man of principles that weren’t appreciated, had to survive by feigning madness. He didn’t abandon his principles, but nor did he try to persuade others to believe in them, or die stubbornly defending them. Rather, Prince Ji “resist[ed] not evil” so that he remained relatively untouched by it, knowing that it would eventually burn itself out. As indeed it did. 
On another note, one thing that intrigued me was Fortune’s obviously conscious decision to use the loaded term “evil” for these processes/forces. It is very effective in making one reconsider how those words relate (or don’t) to value judgments, and how we have personally related to those concepts through our lives. But on a mind-training level it was a brilliant move–the struggle to yank the mind out of its habitual definitions of “good” and “evil,” every time those words are encountered, is like mental weight-lifting and requires one to stay more present and focused while reading and ruminating. Clever Dion.

I suddenly thought of something that is giving all of us ample opportunities to reflect on negative evil in our daily lives: Mars retrograde conjunct the Dragon’s Tail (South Node). I am seeing this manifest all around me in the form of interpersonal conflicts: Besides my day job I have a part time job in retail, and all of us employees seem to be hovering just on the edge of exploding due to record-high levels of stupidity, pettiness, and poor hygiene among our customers, while the customers are lashing out at us. (I’m as guilty as anyone else in this.) One member of my family recently launched a verbal attack at another that the recipient said was unlike anything she had ever witnessed. A coworker says her husband is picking fights over nothing and becoming enraged at her; she’s so mad she’s thinking of calling the marriage quits. Everyone is saying they’re “done” with this or that–jobs, relationships, long-time friendships, family, you name it. Are we “creating a vacuum” around the evil(s) by walking away, allowing it to run its course? Or are we acting out of anger and injured pride and actually stabilizing/perpetuating the conflict? What can we create with this thrust block?

JMG,
First, thanks for organizing this book club and for taking the reading as slowly as you have. This is my first experience with occult philosophy and while it has been fascinating, I can’t imagine going any faster. Much appreciated! 
I started off trying to understand this section using a medical framework, where a surgeon was excising a tumor. It didn’t make sense, I realized, since the tumor is a pathology of excessive growth–positive evil.
I set that aside and started thinking about the decay of a building. Direct confrontation of that (negative) evil can be done by repairing components as they degrade. However, it locks the evil in place: you are now committed to an endless series of repairs forever. It also doesn’t eliminate the evil, just contains it in a manageable way. 
Using the evil as a thrust block to a higher plane would be designing a building that is more robust and resistant to degradation over time than previous designs. Accepting the decay, and letting the building collapse allows the evil to take its course which self-terminates when the building is just a pile of rubble. 
I think this metaphor works pretty well, and has some interesting things to say about entropy and how to interact with it. My question is, what is the Ring-Pass-Not in this scenario? Is it the critical threshold where the building is so run down it is condemned and can’t function as a building any more?

Upon starting out with the first chapter a month ago, I had to look up what a “thrust-block” is. What I found seemed to confirm what the context suggested, that a thrust-block is more or less “something to push against” in order to move something or move oneself somewhere. So I moved on, without paying much attention to the details.
But the discussion of negative evil might require a more specific understanding of just what Fortune was referring to. There seems to be a tendency, in my mind anyhow, for the model of negative evil within the ring-cosmos to collapse into a two-dimensional picture I think of as the “Sumo model” in which, for instance, opponents A and B might be “using each other as thrust blocks” to try to push one another out of the ring (-cosmos). I suspect that could be misleading.
In current usage, the phrase “thrust block” (usually not hyphenated) refers primarily to two things. One is support structures that anchor pipes at certain points to prevent the pipe from being moved by the force (thrust) of the flowing liquid around a corner or through a constriction. The other is a set of special bearings (also known as thrust bearings) used in propeller-driven ships to transmit the thrust of the propeller, which is parallel to the shaft, to the ship’s hull. (And in other cases where there are similar dynamics, such as drilling.)
It seems far more likely that Fortune had the latter type of thrust block in mind, because the former is designed only to maintain a stasis, while the latter facilitates movement; specifically, dynamic rotary motion in a three dimensional system (the plane of the rotation + the perpendicular axis of the shaft), which fits in with the rest of her elaborate metaphor.
Depending on how specifically and how literally Fortune chose the term, some or all the following could be said:
– To provide a thrust-block is not to create a force, nor resist one, but to transmit it from one thing to another.
– Using a thrust block might imply re-directing an impetus in a perpendicular direction (out of the plane of the ring-cosmos, perhaps, toward the plane of rotation of the ring-chaos; or vice versa), rather than just “pushing back” along the same direction, the way the rotary push of a ship’s engine is turned into the axial push along the shaft and hull. Technically it’s not the thrust block itself that does that. it’s the angled blades of the propeller (or drill bit, etc.), but it’s that change of direction that makes the thrust block necessary in the first place.
– Accordingly, opposing equal forces A and B could be locked in stasis in the ring-cosmos, but either or both could still be using that interaction to achieve perpendicular thrust (changes), in opposite directions or even in the same direction.
– If you’re using something as a thrust block, you’re not pushing off of it and leaving it behind; you’re attaching it firmly to yourself and taking it with you.

The thing that I keep tripping over is what I perceive to be moral labels for things that are neither moral or immoral, they just are.  So why is she using a moral description at all?  And she even has a paragraph at the end saying the terms are unsatisfactory…
I also find it odd that she uses the phrase “The Ring-Chaos has its desire…  So is she saying that there is a being that desires these things?
On another note:   Could the animosity towards “red” be an extension of the war against the “red coats”?

One of the difficulties I’m having in interpreting this section is parsing out exactly what constitutes “resisting” evil in any given situation. Take the example of a human body suffering from disease. Is taking antibiotics for a bacterial infection an act of resistance? It’s certainly an action orthogonal to the r-cosmos of the bacteria, but it’s intended to wipe out the infection, not lock it in place as a foundation for further action. Is it necessary to look at it in a more abstract way, such as viewing the r-chaos as the tendency toward disease rstger than any individual illness?
Another question that occurred to me – can you switch between the two strategies for dealing with evil? Can you resist something long enough to create something new and then shift your focus to the new creation, allowing the initial evil to dissolve itself? Or will your new creation fade away like the good works of the Three Rings once the Ring of Power was destroyed?
One possible answer that occurred to me in meditation was that you can make this switch, but only after a new current of resistance emerges to act as the r-chaos for your creation.

Read the Cosmic Doctrine through once, interested in that Dion Fortune reinforced some of Edgar Cayce’s notions. My organizing principle was how does Fortune’s channeling play against E. Schumpeter’s Creative Destruction? and Einstein’s “The fourth world war will be fought with sticks and stones”? 
Haven’t thought enough about Einstein’s statement. However, I looked up the term “evil” in the Index. Dion Fortune seems to be right on the money, to paraphrase, if evil is looked up, there is a vacuum created around it. The only way to meet evil is with good actions. So, yes, Dion Fortune seems to presage Schumpeter’s Creative Destruction.

Good Morning everyone.  So I am a bit late to the party here and I apologize for the stream of consciousness and scattershot nature of the post.  Writing things out seems to be a way I work through things and I probably should expose things to some level of critique.
What happens when various Cosmoi collide?  Assuming we are not dealing with the ultimate highest level of things I have to assume that the Cosmoi will interact on some level.  My first thought was that it might be like the bubbles my kids like to make.  When floating through the air they can: miss each other completely, smack into each other and both pop, smash into each other and combine into something larger, or touch and stick together creating a double bubble.  No model being perfect it misses that idea that the Cosmoi could just bounce off each like a billiard ball. 
With that idea in mind I wanted to think of an example of two radically different Cosmoi running into each other.  Honestly I think the most dramatic one we all are somewhat familiar with would be the Spanish in the New World.  At least I think we can all safely see the Aztec Civilization having a slightly different Ring Cosmos and Ring Chaos than Late Medieval Europeans.  Here I think we can say that we had a case where the two bubbles became one different larger Cosmos.  Or maybe two attached bubbles for a while.  
Regarding the idea that you must “hate the hate.”  I haven’t seen anyone mention this yet but I have to wonder if this isn’t in part an admonition to hate the hate just enough to lock it up and NO MORE.  Otherwise you are wasting energy.  Ie don’t become obsessed with what you are trying to contain.
Following that line of reasoning I started thinking about how this works practically.  Which got me back along the self-defense track.  The best option to avoiding trouble is, of course, not to be there when it starts.  Don’t go stupid places, at stupid times, with stupid people.  Basically isolate it and let it spin out of your life.  If you think about it just think about it enough to establish reasonable boundaries but not so much that you are seeing a rapist or drug dealer behind every blade of grass.
Perhaps a better example might be the idea of the Police on the societal level.  Clearly they exist to contain criminal activity but if they are in place you have a group of first responders available for when life happens: hurricanes, alligators, cats in trees etc.  So you have used the “evil” to build something more broadly useful.
Hopefully I am sniffing in the right direction.  But there a couple of young gentlemen that are now awake and think I should be building dinosaurs out of legos and helping them terrorize their mother.

John Michael,
Thank you for your response to my question about Satan.  That’s about what I figured!  And no wonder Christians are so negative about meditation…what little meditating I’ve done has only ever produced calming and insightful results.  Trying to get more disciplined about doing it.
So is there another AMA post coming up?  I’ve started developing a SoP ritual and have plenty of questions!

Grandmother,
My wife and I were just having the same conversation the other day.  Ever since we “went sane” several years ago we haven’t felt like we have any real friends.  Oh sure, we know and chat regularly with lots of folks, but real friends?  Not really.  The conversation can only get so deep before we run out of common ground altogether.
My wife was lamenting the idea that even if she returned to her hometown of Spokane, WA, her real friends there might not be real friends anymore, since we’ve changed so much since then.  It was difficult for her.
Same thing you mention, that we can be talking to acquaintances and agree that the country has gone mad, but then realize that we’re talking about completely different things…it’s bizarre.
Cheers.
Tripp

Hi Tripp,
If I may offer a correction, Christians are not at all negative about meditation.  The Jesus Prayer, where you repeat his name over and over, goes back a long way, as does the rosary, which is divided into 5 decades of 10 beads each and is centered around various events in the lives and afterlives of Jesus and Mary.  These events are called Mysteries.  You have the 5 Joyful Mysteries (Jesus’s conception, birth, and childhood), the 5 Sorrowful Mysteries(the crucifixion), and the 5 Glorious Mysteries (the Resurrection and events thereafter).  The idea is you meditate on one set of Mysteries while praying your way around the rosary beads.
Pope John Paul II added the Luminous Mysteries but I forget what they are.  😊

@Shane
Re: Boomer generation, etc.
My view of the cycle is influenced by John Xenakis’ Generational Dynamics as well as some Michael channeling on the subject.
Briefly, Michael calls the Idealist/Prophet generation a Resistance generation, which is revolting against what it sees as the stasis of the preceding High/Austerity/Stability period.
It occurs to me that it’s an example of using that stasis as a thrust-block, but when the thrust-block is broken, then there’s nothing to react against.
You might also want to look at the term “sell-out.” Awakening periods are followed by Unraveling periods, and the “sell-out” corresponds to the transition between the Awakening and the following Unraveling. It seems to me that the people who think it was a “sell-out” were trying to build something, and Unraveling periods are essentially destructive. It’s releasing energy that was tied up in fixed patterns, but the energy isn’t being directed to build anything – the appearance of growth isn’t actually creating permanent structures.

The Spirit=Cosmos and Matter=Chaos correspondences bothered me, too; what I came up with was that matter is inevitably drawn toward dissolution (after which its constituent elements may be restructured into something new), whereas spirit persists, complexifies and integrates with successive incarnations (or discarnate lifetimes, eventually).

Thanks, JMG, for choosing Cos Doc for group reading. If I had the power to grant titles, I would declare Dion Fortune to be “Mage of the 20th Century”! Your interpretation and examples in this second installment have been enormously clarifying (I am working from the reprint of the original Cos Doc). The use of “negative evil” as a springboard is a concept that I am still working on (I don’t claim to be a fast learner) and am trying to compare to the traditional Hindu 4-step method of dealing with evil persons: 1) drawing to the person’s attention that what they are doing is harmful [“sarasa” in Sanskrit]; 2) offering the evil person an incentive (“trade-off”) for giving up the harmful activity [“sama-dana” in Sanskrit]; 3) warning the person to mend their ways / threaten them [“bheda” in Sanskrit] and finally 4) directly confronting with the evil person – violently, if required [“dand” in Sanskrit]. At the same time, I am a huge admirer of Mahatma Gandhi who combined traditional Hindu concepts with Tolstoy’s concept of non-violence. I will return to these concepts later when we discuss “positive evil” and practical examples from history of using the Cos Doc techniques in effectively dealing with them. For now, I am trying to get the concept discussed in this month’s reading rattle around in my conscious mind and sink into my unconscious mind.

								July 18, 2018 at 5:14 am							




Hi JMG,
I realized with this reading that I had part of this structure understood incorrectly which had led me to fundamentally misunderstand something about what Fortune is getting at with regards to “manifestation”.  I thought that the Ring-Chaos was INSIDE the Ring-Pass-Not, which led me to believe that the reverse movement was also part of manifestation, because it was also in motion as a result of the motion of a Ring-Cosmos.  I realize now that manifestation is relative to the Ring-Cosmos, it is not an objective statement about what exists, it is a judgment of a goal being realized.  The manifest is the good, the motion of the Ring-Cosmos.
Do I have that right now?  It was a fairly serious mistake and I had to rethink what I believed she was getting at.
Thanks,
Johnny

To JMG (and to Jen, who shares my difficulty re spirit and matter).
“What is Fortune implying by reversing what seem like the obvious relationships of spirit and matter to the Rings”
I know that this “jumps ahead” a bit, but it seems easier for me to understand the relationship of spirit and matter by adding the third concept: life.  The “synthesis,” as it were, to the “thesis” (spirit) and the “antithesis” (matter), by which they are locked into a dance together that makes bodies in which dwell autonomous centres of will and awareness, and from which spring autonomous action, each bounded by a ring-pass-not in the form of a membrane (or in multi-cellular form, a skin).   
Life lives when spirit uses matter’s tendency to entropy to continually assemble itself – molecular autopoeisis, which is a beautiful use of the thrust-block principle. Spirit’s tendency is to build it’s centre (to acquire, perhaps, the experiences, and the relationships, and to perform the acts, which will make it more ITSELF, through life after life.  Matter’s tendency is towards the “space” (the sea of matter) which surrounds every “3-Ring-Cosmos-Set” that is a living body. So long as a living body can continue to assemble itself by judicious control of what passes in and out through it’s Ring-Pass-Not it lives.  When it can no longer assemble itself, it ceases to be, its matter disintegrates, its spirit passes on, its life ceases.   
I pondered on this a bit, as it seems that the Ring-Pass-Not of the skin and/or of the membrane (in the case of a unicellular living body), is not a proper barrier, in that individual molecules can, of course, pass through it in both directions.  However, the brilliant biological theoretical work of the Chilean authors Humberto Maturana and Varela, (Cognition and Autopoeisis), develops a radical idea that a being’s “cognition” is completely built of the awarenesses that build up via changes to its own structure contained within its membrane.   That, although the world is continually disturbing and provoking such changes, the awareness of the world outside the membrane is always made by the structure within, and the recreation WITHIN of a complete model of what the outside world must be like to have provoked such structural changes.  That is to say, that a living being’s cognition of the world IS in some important sense, limited by the Ring-Pass-Not, that is the sensing system their own membrane and/or skin and multicellular sensing systems can model within.  I struggle with this, but it is interesting to see the same idea echoed in these two places.  
As for myself, I am reluctant to go the gnostic route and conceive of the material body as the enemy of spirit.  Rather I think it is more concordant with my personal love of life (biophilia), to conceive of my living body as “created” by spirit using matter as its thrust block, so that in life I may love, understand, create, and experience. My body is not my enemy.  Living is creation, seized from destruction.

Hi JMG,
It seems to me that part of the goal of this work is to picture this series of mental images which are counter intuitive.  For instance, I have never once tried to picture two opposing forces as having a relationship where they travel at 90 degree angles.  I, like I assume everyone else, would immediately picture two forces travelling in opposite directions.  It’s not impossible to conceive of it happening at 90s, but it’s unusual and takes some effort as it doesn’t follow from what you understand about the world so you have to train yourself to get it to stick.  I feel like even if I were to never think about this again I would have a hard time forgetting this relationship of rings (even the way she refers to discs, rings and spheres by the same term seems like this – not exactly difficult, but not something that is natural).  Is she deliberately causing this frustration as a way of providing thrust-blocks for our understanding?  To push us towards building up the centre?
Thanks,
Johnny







 Simon S says:

The distinction between ways of dealing with evil reminded of an exchange between Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins in (I think it was) The Four Horseman video they produced.
Hitchens said that he wouldn’t want religion to disappear because he enjoys sparring with it (or words to that effect). Dawkins exclaimed his shock at this sentiment.  He stated how he hoped to get rid of religion altogether.
By Fortune’s analysis, Hitchens had locked in religion as his evil.  Dawkins on the other hand believed he was fighting for a victory that would be achieved when religion was abolished.
Thus, Dawkins is fighting a futile battle. Like Hitchens, he has locked in religion as his evil. But he thinks he can destroy religion in this way when it actual fact he only supports its continued existence.

I’ve been pondering the comment that “the undisciplined man, knowing the usefulness of evil, would try to use it dynamically in the plane of its motion”. It sounds like she’s suggesting that someone with an incomplete understanding of these principles might think they could use deliberate evil or destruction as a foundation for creative work.
 I have difficulty imagining what this would look like in practice. Deliberately attacking something you value in the hopes of inspiring a constructive response? Creating a “manufactured opposition”? Or perhaps a warped version of the left-hand path approach where immorality is indulged in and viewed as necessary for spiritual development rather than a strategic tool for harnessing the power of a broken taboo?







 Dirtyboots says: 



								July 22, 2018 at 9:10 pm							




JMG,
The surgical metaphor resonated strongly with me.  In this case, the body’s capacity to heal wounds well is the “superabundance of good” that empowers the building of something new (health) on top of the thrust block (a clean wound).  Having seen the poor results of surgery attempted in those who–due to chronic illness–lack the capacity to heal wounds well, it occurs to me that before opposing negative evil one must be absolutely certain that the right internal resources are at hand in the right proportion.  Also, being absolutely clear of the desired outcome is essential–so often surgery is attempted for the wrong reasons and with little discussion of what it is we’re attempting to achieve.  We oppose the evil of the acute illness because it is abhorrent in our eyes, not recognizing that maybe it will only result in a Pyrrhic victory.







 Dirtyboots says: 



								July 22, 2018 at 11:15 pm							




A dimension of “Hating the hate” is awareness of the responsibility and consequences of wielding force in opposition to a negative evil.  It is self-restraint, inertia applied consciously to one’s own act.  To return to our surgeon performing an appendectomy, she must wield the scalpel with reluctance, not vigor, incising the tissue planes with precision.  The cutting stops once the insult is removed.  Too wide or deep a cut could kill.  The surgeon who fails to hate the hate is a butcher; the one who does is just.







 The Jackfruit Druid says: 



								July 23, 2018 at 8:39 am							




Hello JMG,
What struck me meditating on this particular part of the CosDoc, is the to the extent of which we react to the word Evil by projecting it to the Other, as your Nazi reference points out, never to ourselves. Fortune’s view offers an interesting antidote to this, since it’s a given we are constantly working in a different axis in different systems at the same time. We on the margins of society are certainly viewed as at least a little Evil by those invested on the status quo! Which also reminds me of your suggestion to work building different options for the future instead of entering into open polarity with the current political aspects of our predicament, allowing ourselves to be treated as forces of chaos that have to be dealt with.
All the best!

Hi JMG,
I spent a fair bit of time this month going back to the first chapter and working through the mechanics of the motions line by line.  I wanted to be exactly sure my mental image was right because each aspect of this relates symbolically to the relationships she is describing and I thought if my concept of it was messy I would misunderstand how to apply these insights.
As a result I have some questions about things that stood out – I suspect these are things not ready to be answered yet, or ones I need to answer for myself, but I thought I’d try.
When she describes the Ring Cosmos encircling the Ring-Pass-Not she means encircling from within it?
She describes the the Ring-Chaos as wanting to extend the circumference.  Does she mean the circumference of the Ring-Chaos or does she mean the circumference of the Ring-Pass-Not?  The way it’s written makes it sound like she means to increase the Ring-Pass-Not, but that would be to lessen the limitations of the Ring-Comsos which seems wrong.
She says the Ring-Cosmos has it’s desire turned towards the sphere it encircles.  This sounds like a sphere in the centre of the RIng-Comsos.  When I read this I want to think that this sphere it encircles is the Logos.  That this is where it adds “more space” and concentrates.  But she used the same language of encircling to describe it’s relationship to the Ring-Pass-Not and it would make sense that the Ring-Cosmos would like to increase the size of the Ring-Pass-Not, so as to lessen it’s limitations.
Can the same person be creatures of two opposing Cosmoses?  So opposite that from the perspective of each Cosmos the other Cosmos seems evil?
What does she mean by Scavenger of the Gods?  Is it that Evil wants to return things to the realm of the Unmanifest and therefore to be freed up from specific manifestation?
I’m also quite curious about Negative Good, it is what is attracted to Positive Evil in her explanation of the secondary motion.  I am assuming she goes back to this point?  Or has she already and I missed it?
Thanks,
Johnny

Hi JMG,
I wanted to mention another thing that has come out of reflecting on this.  I said last month that I thought that this was a way of considering potential, and I think that is true, but not in the way that I meant before.  Her description of the Unmanifest being without qualities and without history means that considering it is not really worth while.  It’s like thinking about nothing more than it’s like thinking about anything.
Here is an example:  If I walk around my neighborhood I see people that I know and often I will stop and speak to them.  There is a moment of opportunity that we both take advantage of.  If I have the contacts for everyone I know in my cell phone, in theory I can have this sort of exchange with anyone I know whenever I like.  What happens though is that now I am always contemplating speaking to all of them and so now I have to consider on some level that every moment is a moment where I didn’t speak to any of them.  This contemplation of the Unmanifest is not useful to me, in fact being aware of it means that the weight of what hasn’t happened totally obscures the potential.  I think embracing this for too long can erode the connection between me and the people I know because it places even a the chance encounter in the context of a long period of unused potential.
I think there is a useful comparison here to the idle contemplation of numerous goals without narrowing your focus.  Or do you think I’m misunderstanding her here?
Thanks,
Johnny

I’ve studied I Ching for a while and Fortune’s good and evil sound a lot like yang and yin to me.  Yang is firm and creative.  Yin is yielding and receptive. Superior men are patient, which requires firmness to sustain. Inferior men have little patience and like to surround themselves with others.  Some hexagrams of the I Ching have a similar warning about negative evil — that opposing it gives it strength.
I tested Fortune’s ideas with a current problem. I found out my seventeen year old daughter smokes pot, and I’m very opposed to it.
The I Ching said “Youthful Folly” and warned that the student had to come respectfully to the teacher. I think it means that I can’t lecture her, but have to wait for her to come to me.
The first question was whether pot is a negative or a positive evil.  She smokes because her friends do.  She yields to them. So it feels yin, and like negative evil.
So far, I’ve managed not to lecture, but its been touch-and-go.

It’s been almost a year since the melee at Charlottesville Virginia, and the events have been coming to the fore in the news again, and I have been thinking of this in terms of this segment. First there was the setup:  After Trump had become the Republican candidate that wasn’t supposed to win it became okay to resist him. It became useful to point out racists who endorsed him.  I think this was trying to use evil dynamically – was not about stopping the racists, about using them to tarnish Trump.  There were fringe crackpots – self-important youtube video makers with followings in the hundreds who overnight were lifted forward – or propelled further on their trajectory? – to become household names.
I believe this increased their strength, increased the evil, as opposed to locking them up.
At another scale, we have the two sides (or two of the sides,) involved in the event – I’ll call them the fa and the antifa.  They seem to me to be a cosmos within the larger cosmos above, both resisting and locking eachother up.  Each group within has its own two rings, and each individual within, their own two rings that wound them up in their groups to begin with.  These seem to be locked up – becoming permanent, but I don’t see growth coming of it.
By the end of it, a young woman was brutally murdered, and a young man became a murderer.  Political violence, ring chaos to a deliberative democratic ring Cosmos was strengthened, seems to be spreading this summer and may become a regular fixture.
I’ve been thinking about the concept of creating a vacuum in this context as well – how to create a vacuum around the neo-nazis and skinheads and cohorts as they tried to provoke skirmishes through the town.  My first thought was, wouldn’t it be great if everyone just ignored them.  But that would not work – would not be a vacuum as they would find ways to not be ignored.  It seems that when the murder happened, the counter protesters thought they were done, that the neo-nazis had left town.  That appearance of vacuum was shattered.
So I think there must be a more active, vigilant aspect to creating a vacuum.  I tend to think of a vacuum as the absence, but I suppose you can’t separate that absence from the apparatus and container necessary to create it.  It has been argued that the police were not present that day, and allowed the conflict – the opposing resistances, certainly possible.
Sure would have been easier to create a vacuum in the first phase of this, but I think that may not have been the intent.

Hi JMG,
I would like you to apply Dion Fortune’s principle that opposing something will lock it into place, and make it permanent to Apple/Google/Facebook’s banning of Alex Jones. I rarely listen to Alex Jones, but because of this event I find myself very sympathetic and supportive of him. I don’t disapprove of what Alex Jones says; yet, I’m reminded of the famous quote:  “I wholly disapprove of what you say and will defend to the death your right to say it.”  I would love to see a mass exodus from these mega platforms to block-chain alternatives. How do you see this playing out?

I usually don’t post controversial subjects on my Facebook feed, but the recent 1984-ish ban of Alex Jones/InfoWars from Apple, Google, and Facebook had me coming out with anti-censorship guns blazing.  
I warned people that censoring Alex Jones would result in an unprecedented fascination with his content, because nothing is as tantalizing as that which is forbidden.  
Predictably, a strong leftist acquaintance of mine cheered the censorship, commenting how he wished Jones would be carted off to the funny farm for being a conspiracy theorist.  When I pointed out how the Left was creating a martyr in Jones as well as infringing upon his First Amendment rights, he became lunatic with accusations of ad hominem, which was classic projection of his own shadow, as far as I could tell from his weird, personal jabs at me.  
True to form, Alex Jone’s app is trending as the fourth most popular Apple news app within 48 short hours after the ban.  The Ctrl-Left buttressed their own opposition and gave their evil another thrust block so it could eat at them like a cancer.  You’d think it would be terminal this time around.

Concurrent with the visioning meditation, over the last few months I have developed a fresh awareness of my cosmic geo-location. I look at the night sky, and for the first time in 61 years on Earth I see the great plane of the solar system, the procession of planets through the night along one single line from East to West, from open sky to horizon; the orbital plane’s apparent slight tilt to the South because of Earth’s own rotational tilt, and my location North of the equator. And on a moonless night such as this … the Milky Way beyond following its own complex geometry of visual placement in the night sky.
What I really enjoy is … sitting on my balcony facing West at sunset, and watch the sun disappear slowly beyond the horizon. A few weeks ago the paradigm shifted. Instead of the sun appearing to fall slowly, I feel my chair and planet Earth slowly rotate backward vis-a-vis a motionless sun – which is the accurate picture.

@kimerlysteel
Apple and the others’ action is more understandable when you know that Jones has two lawsuits for defamation in process.  If they didn’t ban him, they themselves could be sued for assisting his defamation.
The key thing is that false speech isn’t protected by the Constitution because it doesn’t help a free people make collective decisions.  Defamation isn’t protected by the First Amendment.

I was thrilled to read this chapter! I gave a lecture yesterday on the tarot Kings and Knights for a court cards class I am teaching, and the series of statements on p. 15 perfectly reflects the points I was trying to express to my class. In particular, I was contrasting how those characters vary whether placed at Yod / Chokmah (the higher rank) or Vav / Tiphareth (the lower rank) on the Tree. When the Chevalier (the Knight, or the highest rank in the GD system or Thoth deck, but lower rank in the RWS deck) is placed at Tiphareth, he expands the center. When placed at Chokmah his energy either needs to be directed inward to evolve or he dissolves out into outer space. When the Throned King (highest rank in Waite’s deck, or alternately the Prince in GD/Thoth lineage) is placed center, he increases the gravity of the kingdom, centralizing and concretizing power. When placed at Chokmah, he understands the restrictions of the outer limits and marks them. I suppose when I place these two ranks in the context of Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos, perhaps you could say that the Throned King at center is the Ring-Cosmos (solidifies by contraction), Mounted King at Center is also Ring-Cosmos (expands the center), the Mounted King at the outer level is the Ring-Chaos (sucked into outer space) (unless he evolves towards center), while the Throned King at the outer level actually becomes the Ring-Pass-Not (“the bounds beyond which the creatures of that sphere cannot pass even in thought”). Huh. I’ll have to think about that one. 
How does the Ring-Cosmos extend the center when it thrusts towards the center? I suppose through consolidation, concretization, like a planet building up from space debris pulled into its gravity. The Ring-Cosmos must burst beyond the border at some point as it grows and the Ring-Chaos dissolves. That must be what she means by its influence being unchecked — static in the immediate present. (Now I need to figure out what the immediate present means. You wouldn’t think it would be so hard. Hmm. How do we build a perpetual motion machine?) Seems like the Ring-Cosmos must check its own progress to some degree. It needs Ring-Chaos. Or it gets too big and weighty to revolve and stops its evolution. (Gosh, now I sound like you with  your Archdruid nemyss on.)
Ok, evil and good. Yes, absolutely, this makes perfect sense with the tarot Kings and Knights. The Knight is Ring-Chaos without a doubt because he always opposes the trajectory of evolution, his job is to overthrow, rebel, revolt. He is at right angles to the current evolution (why Crowley returned him to the higher rank, to harness those energies).
Well, I think that’s all I’ve got for today. I’m sorry my “homework” is so late. I was out of town for a couple weeks and before and after that working hard on preparing for this class I’m teaching, it’s a new one that I haven’t taught before. 
I don’t know if you’ll even see this, but I’m posting anyway. Thank you for not closing comments. I was always late with my papers in college…

Not the Monthly Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Twelve Rays and the Seven Cosmic Planes 
August 15, 2018August 15, 2018John Michael Greer148 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected.
As noted in earlier posts here, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 3, “The Twelve Rays and the Seven Cosmic Planes,” p. 18-22.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 2, “The First Trinity,” pp. 26-31, and the first three paragraphs of the following chapter.
Commentary:
This is an extremely complex chapter in which a great many concepts are covered very briefly, so we’ll take things a step at a time. We pick up again where we left off, with the three great Rings—the Ring-Chaos, the Ring-Cosmos, and the Ring-Pass-Not—all in place. As in last month’s reading, it’s useful for what follows to imagine them at right angles to one another, as shown in the diagram below.
The text summarizes the points already made about the three Rings, and stresses that only the Ring-Cosmos can create anything, because the forces of the Ring-Chaos diffuse outward into infinity. The Ring-Cosmos has a limit—the Ring-Pass-Not—which prevents its forces from diffusing; instead, they act and interact among themselves and produce complexity. Notice here one of the fundamental principles of esoteric philosophy: creation requires limitation. To bring something into being is to accept limits. To reject limits is to guarantee that whatever you do will dissolve uselessly into the Void.
This is a very difficult concept for most people nowadays to grasp. Now as in Dion Fortune’s time, a great deal of pop spirituality fixates on the notion that limits are always bad and that you can and should free yourself of all limits. There’s a certain value to these teachings, since a great many people limit themselves in self-defeating ways. Believing that there are no limits can help people shake off limiting beliefs that they’ve absorbed from their parents, teachers, or culture, and accomplish things they didn’t believe they could do. The difficulty here is, first, that unfairly limiting beliefs aren’t the only kind of limits that exist, and second, that believing that there are no limits itself imposes certain very sharp limits on those who hold this belief.
One of the many cats Dion Fortune let out of the bag in The Cosmic Doctrine—it’s discussed in Chapter 25—is the reason why the fixation on limitlessness became so widespread in 20th century pop spirituality: it was one way for occult groups to create a readily accessible pool of force that could be directed by the group’s adepts. There were a number of such gimmicks, and most of the big public occult groups of the time used one or more of them relentlessly, teaching exercises to the largest possible number of novices that mostly functioned as ways to charge the pool of forces, and then selecting from among the novices the few who had the discipline, intelligence, and commitment to become adepts themselves and work with the pool of forces.
This doesn’t have to be done in a secretive and abusive manner. The more reputable occult schools, Dion Fortune’s among them, were quite open about what they were doing, and explained to participants how their contributions of force would be used. Churches by and large used to do the same thing. Read Christian writings about group worship from before the First World War and very often the concept of group prayer as a source of energy is all but spelled out. Of course you then have to have priests or ministers who know what to do with the energy thus collected, and that’s become increasingly rare as today’s churches embrace modern, up-to-date, cutting-edge notions of clergy training that guarantee that the clergy thus trained will be hopelessly ignorant concerning the magical dimensions of the ceremonies they perform.
It doesn’t help that many of the ceremonies in question have been revised by people who were guided by fashionable notions of relevance rather than any grasp of magical principles, and that many of the practices given to the laity to guide their end of the work have been abolished or neglected due to reforms with similar motivations.  In some denominations, as a result, the services no longer bring in any energy at all, and you get at best a pleasant gathering with some moral platitudes thrown in for seasoning, and at worst one of those undead churches that would not feel noticeably different if the minister and congregation had all been expertly embalmed.
In other denominations the energy still comes in, but since no one knows what to do with it any more, it sits unused and turns stagnant. It usually ends up discharging through the clergy using the normal outlet of the life force, and you get another sexual scandal. I’m not sure how many people realize that the decrease in miracles and the  increase in sexual scandals among clergy have the identical cause, but from the point of view of occult philosophy, it’s obvious.
The Cosmic Doctrine, though, was written for those who want to work with power, not for those who simply want to sit in the congregation and contribute power for the person up front to work with. If you want to work with power, you need to understand what, in a later chapter, Fortune will call the Law of Limitation. The principles that underlie that law are the ones we’ve been covering in the two chapters we’ve read already.
You embrace limitation when you want to create and sustain something; you release limitation when you want something to dissolve into the Void. As you create and sustain something, though, it takes on unexpected qualities.  In the metaphoric language of our text, the forces we’re discussing are movements of empty space, but as movement reaches its maximum complexity it produces a second kind of activity, which our text describes as light; when light, in turn, reaches its maximum complexity it produces a third kind of activity, which our text describes as sound.
This is one of the places where it’s crucial to remember that The Cosmic Doctrine is a system of metaphors meant to teach occult philosophy, not a physics textbook. In physics, movement doesn’t create light and light doesn’t create sound, except in certain jerry-rigged instances. In the metaphor we’re using, things are otherwise, and it’s worth spending time imagining movement creating light and light creating sound, and then considering what this might mean.   One point of the metaphor—there are others—is that movement, color, and sound comprise the three primary tools of the operative mage, and are combined in even the simplest magical working. Another point of the metaphor, more broadly applicable than the first, is that activity of one form can cause activity in other forms, and if you’re not paying attention, this can blindside you.
As force begets force, and the movements of the Ring-Cosmos flow back inward, the simple spinning movement described earlier breaks apart into a cascade of more complex movements, accompanied by light and sound. The first set of these complex movements are the Twelve Rays, which radiate from the center to the circumference and return to the center again. Our text calls them “a set of revolving spirals,” which may be confusing unless you know that the words “spiral” and “helix” were treated as interchangeable by a great many authors in Dion Fortune’s time. The Rays are streams of force that spin around their own axis of movement as they flow out from the center and return to it, and the meeting of the Rays in the center turns the center into a great cauldron of energies—in Fortune’s language, the Central Sun.
Each Ray is paired with the Ray that flows out in the opposite direction. For the purpose of the metaphor, the energies of the Ring-Cosmos are imagined as a disk spinning around the Central Sun, like an old-fashioned vinyl record around the spindle at the center of the turntable. Of each pair of Rays, one flows out along the upper surface of the disk and returns along the lower, while the other flows out along the lower surface and returns along the upper.

“This is a very deep truth, closely related to practical occultism,” notes Fortune. When she says something evasive and portentous like this, by the way, you can take it for granted that she’s hinting at polarity magic, the mode of magical working with sexual energies that was central to her inner teachings. You’ll find the basic theory, including an explanation of what she’s hinting at here, in her book The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage.
So we’ve got the spinning disk of energies with twelve Rays flowing out from the Central Sun and returning to it. The movements of the Rays then set up stresses in the disk that divide it into seven concentric rings. These are the seven Circles, which are also the seven Cosmic Planes. It’s important not to mistake these for the seven planes discussed in practical occultism; as we’ll see, the Cosmos is the whole of which individual solar systems (in Fortune’s terms, “universes”) are tiny parts, and the seven planes that you and I can work with belong to our own solar system, which exists in its entirety on the seventh Cosmic Plane.
With the development of the seven Cosmic Planes the evolution of the Cosmos is complete. The three Rings, seven Planes, and twelve Rays form the background to everything else that happens. (Those of my readers who know anything about the Cabala know exactly where these numbers come from and what they refer to; those who don’t can find the details in Dion Fortune’s book The Mystical Qabalah or my somewhat less evasive book Paths of Wisdom.) It’s what happens within that framework that will concern us from here on in.
What happens within that framework, first of all, is that the movements of the Rays as they cross the spinning Circles set off additional movements in space, which our text calls “Tangentials.” The Tangentials are brief movements of space that flow off at various angles, and when there are enough of them in a given region of the cosmos, they collide with each other. (In Chapter 4, Fortune explains that this happens where the Rays intersect with one another to form the Central Sun.) When two Tangentials set in motion by different Rays collide, they deflect each other’s motion, and start spinning around each other, forming a stable unit. Notice here another of the fundamental principles of esoteric philosophy: when you oppose something you lock it into place, and you lock yourself into a relationship with it.
Two tangential movements spinning around each other, locked into relationship with each other, and forming a single vortex: this is a prime atom. This is another of those places where it’s important to remember that the Cosmic Doctrine is not a physics textbook; the atoms we’re discussing aren’t the kind that physicists study. They are metaphors, remember, meant to train the mind rather than inform it.
The prime atoms are the building blocks from which everything else in the Cosmos is made. Some of them, as we’ll see, remain prime atoms, but others interact with other prime atoms and form composite atoms. The process is the same as the one that formed the prime atoms:  two prime atoms collide, deflect each other’s motion, and start spinning around each other, forming a stable unit. The process continues as the composite atoms absorb more influences and become more complex. Eventually, in place of a simple spinning, you get a pattern of motion that approximates an angular figure, with from three to ten sides.
The atoms, prime and composite, then sort themselves out through something not too far from centrifugal motion. Those prime atoms that remain unattached stay in the Central Sun. Those that have become composite begin to drift outwards, and settle out into one of the seven Circles: the three-sided composite atoms into the circle just outside the Central Sun, the four-sided atoms into the next circle out, and so on, out to the nine-sided atoms, which fill the seventh circle. And the ten-sided ones? We’ll get to those in a later chapter.
Toward the end of the chapter, Fortune drops two broad hints. The first is the recapitulation that assigns the numbers 1 through 5 to five different movements covered in The Cosmic Doctrine, and thence to five basic concepts. Those concepts are among other things the first five of the ten Spheres of the Tree of Life, seen from a particular point of view, and those of my readers who know their way around Cabalistic symbolism may find it interesting to explore the Tree of Life from this standpoint.
The second is one of the few places she gets close to explaining a concept that pervades The Cosmic Doctrine but is never quite explained in so many words. You will remember from Chapter 1 that the Ring-Cosmos rotates relative to the Ring-Chaos, and that this rotation forms the Ring-Pass-Not. You will also remember from Chapter 2 that the angle in which the Ring-Cosmos starts moving originally defines “good” for that Cosmos, while the angle of the Ring-Chaos, which is perpendicular to the original angle of the Ring-Cosmos, defines “evil.”
As the Ring-Cosmos rotates, in other words, it gradually approaches the angle of the Ring-Chaos, then passes through that angle and out the other side, diverging from it until it returns to its original angle (though it’s turned over and is therefore upside down and spinning in the opposite direction). Then, as it turns further, it approaches the angle of the Ring-Chaos again, passes through it, and returns to its original angle in its original orientation.
This is the basis for what occult philosophy calls the Days and Nights of Manifestation. This is the vastest of all the cycles that shape the Cosmos, the one that governs the rise and fall of universes. The rule here is simple: when the Ring-Cosmos is rotating toward the angle of the Ring-Chaos, that’s a Day of Manifestation, and when the Ring-Cosmos is rotating toward its own angle, that’s a Night of Manifestation.
Why? Because the Ring-Chaos is what sets things in motion. If the Ring-Cosmos were to rotate at its original angle forever, nothing would ever change or grow or evolve; as mentioned in Chapter 2, the Ring-Cosmos unchecked is static in the present moment. The Ring-Chaos provides the force that tips the balance and sets the Cosmos moving. So there are two Days and two Nights of Manifestation in each full rotation of the Ring-Cosmos. Each Day begins as the attraction of the Ring-Chaos overturns the static balance of the previous Night, and ends as those forces set in motion that haven’t established an equilibrium with the rest of the Cosmos are drawn out to the Ring-Pass-Not, the boundary of existence, and dissolve into the Unmanifest. Every Night begins as the remaining forces start to settle into their equilibrium, and ends as the wholly balanced and equilibrated Cosmos is disturbed anew by the attraction of the Ring-Chaos.
In itself, even if it wasn’t a metaphor, that would be of limited use to human occultists, who exist in an eyeblink of Cosmic time. What makes this useful is that every smaller cycle in the Cosmos has similar phases. This is true, for example, of the cycles of the day, the lunar month, and the year. Take the lunar month for an example. The period between the New Moon and the First Quarter is favorable for beginning anything new; the period between the First Quarter and the Full Moon is favorable for strengthening and consolidating things; the period between the Full Moon and the Last Quarter is favorable for making changes; the period between the Last Quarter and the New Moon is favorable for ending and letting go.
The reference to “the numbers of the secret calendar” is a reference to this. There are various systems for tracking tides of the sort just set out, ranging from relatively simple methods such as watching the phases of the Moon, to maddeningly intricate numerological and calendrical systems that take a lot of study to grasp. The point remains the same, which is that time is not just an undifferentiated flow; it cycles through different phases, and some of those phases are more favorable for certain activities than others.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text. There are a lot of images in this chapter, so take your time and try to imagine each one as clearly as you can.
As you do this, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on September 12. Until then, have at it!

John–
I am (gradually) accepting that Reality is not an object of knowledge; however — dear gods! — this text is maddeningly opaque.  I reread the chapter last night in preparation for today’s post and I still got less than half (honestly, less than a third) of what you elucidated here this morning.  I’ll keep at it, and thank you for doing this study.  I’d never have gotten even this far on my own.

David, remember that this text was originally circulated solely among an inner circle of Fortune’s students: that is, people who already had an extensive training in occult philosophy, and were used to the style of writing Fortune uses — not a small thing!  That is to say, yeah, it’s maddeningly opaque. I spent a long time pounding my head against it before I finally read enough other occult literature to be able to make sense of it.

MOVEMENT —> COLOR —–> SOUND
Perhaps a fair analogy to this process would be the pollinator gardens I planted; first I worked the soil, adding manure and transplanting the starts, which is movement; then the purple flowers of the Anise Hyssop grew, which is color; and last came the buzzing of the bumble bees, which is the sound. This then created a little cosmos, or ecosystem, that has its own, self-sustaining life with a regular pattern of movement, plant growth, color in the flowering and sound in the arriving bumblebees with the Day of Manifestation, the growing season; and Night of Manifestation, in this context, winter.

I don’t know how the rights of such things work, but if you haven’t already considered the idea, I’d encourage you to explore the possibility of producing an annotated edition of The Cosmic Doctrine or perhaps a solo work of Commentaries.

John,
Reading this made me think of the relation of freedom to structure.  For example, there’s a great deal of creative freedom within the structure of a sonnet or a haiku.  In mathematics (where I’ve contibuted some original results in combinatorics) there’s a great deal of creative freedom within a set of axioms and rules of logic.  But there comes a time when the possibilities of a structure become exhausted, at least where major breakthroughs are concerned. (You had mentioned this in a much earlier column in connection with musical theatre, which was nearing that point.) So, I’m thinking, with societies. Consumerism must have seemed very liberating at first to people who grew up in relative want and some of the expressions–the car culture of the 1950’s for example–were wonderful.  But now that structure’s being exhausted (among other things, by literal resource exhaustion), and ready to dissolve, and some other organizing principle will arise in its wake.

Violet, an elegant meditation on the theme! Thank you. 
David, not only have I considered it, I’ve got a publisher lined up. 😉 Since Dion Fortune’s works went out of copyright last year, there’ll be no obstacle to a book of commentaries — the same publisher will also be bringing out a new printing of the revised edition. 
Greg, excellent! Fortune talks about exactly that process later in the text — you get a new influence, it shakes everything up, then the new influence gradually gets integrated and equilibrated and things settle down into a rut until the next new influence comes along. No question, we’re ready for the next influence.

I found the discussion of limits as necessary for creation and manifestation rather liberating 😉 as well as making a whole lot of sense.  Limitlessness as powerlessness was an eye-opening thought.

“…to become adepts themselves and work with the pool of forces.” Not to mention the large bank accounts thus engendered. These teachings were rarely, if ever, given for free (at least in the latter half of the last century) and many were quite costly in both time and money. Many organizations amassed huge amounts of wealth and property by opening up to one and all, provided they could afford the programs.

Regarding the need for limits it makes sense that if you wanted to concentrate energy you’d need to keep it in an insulated container. It makes magic sound like a Carnot heat engine where you don’t want any more energy leaking away than is absolutely unavoidable. Makes me wonder if there’s a magic equivalent of CCHP and quadgeneration that wring every last drop of work out of it.

To JMG, I dug out my copy of “Art of the Osage” by Garrick Alan Bailey and was intrigued by the resemblance of the traditional cosmology of the native Osage people to Dion Fortune’s Cosmic Doctrine.

Presumably the annual cycle ought to work the same way as the lunar cycle, e.g., fall being for making changes, winter for letting go.  But would the winter solstice correspond to the new moon, or would you start somewhere else?  (The cross-quarter days have always made more sense to me for definition of seasons, e.g., Samhain to Imbolc equals winter.)







 Imbrium says: 



								August 15, 2018 at 12:40 pm							




I’m picturing the recent and awesome pictures of the stable, perhaps mutually supportive atmospheric vortexes on Jupiter. All things in motion, motion balanced by equivalent yet opposite motion, all in a dance of motion that defies human expression. Perhaps I wax overly poetic, and this is clearly a sign that I need to study a great deal more in order to have the necessary vocabulary for expression. Either way, I appreciate this book study. Thank you.

In response to a previous comment, I was also thinking about the idea of limits and creativity.  When I studied the music of J.S. Bach for the first time, the teacher said that Baroque music had very strict limits, and that Bach remained within those limits as a composer, and yet created a vast amount of exquisite music.  And he created it under strict time pressures, which makes it all the more amazing to me.
Reading this way, with you as a guide, is really interesting.  It is hitting on so many things that I try to think about, but just have trouble grasping.  thanks. Kathy

John, my shallow understanding takes the metaphor of the ring-cosmos and ring-chaos in such a way that I see the ring-chaos generated at every point of the ring-cosmos in opposition to the movement of ring cosmos. It’s this “every point” relationship that establishes the shell of the ring-pass-not, so each point has it’s own thrust block and with all the rings and rays inside allows for the massive complexity of a universe. So evil, as spin toward limitless un-manifestation, is ever present. I know that good and evil “are not ‘good’ and ‘evil’ as you understand these terms.” However, in your recent KW4 comments you described San Francisco (really well…) as influenced by either the luciferien or ahrumanian type of evil. Do those types of evil relate to the ring chaos evil (positive/negative)?

Dear John Michael Greer,
Thank you for blogging about this. I am glad indeed to know that your annotated edition is in the works.
I would be interested to read more about how, as you write, “activity of one form can cause activity in other forms, and if you’re not paying attention, this can blindside you.”
Re: limits. @ Greg Simay commented on the creative freedom of the limits imposed by haiku, for example. As a poet myself, one who favors the 5-7-5 form, I heartily agree with that. 
Appreciatively,

John,
Thank you so much for all the work you do, it is making such a difference in my life.
This week’s discussion of limits fits in well with the discussion in the comments last week about the other native American archetype embodied in modern America- the Wendigo.  The unending hunger and insatiable greed of the Wendigo has taken over our social system (now I know my enemies name).
My first instinct is to fight it with everything I have – oppose it with all of my being.  But if I understand correctly if I try to do that I will be locking the Wendigo in place and defeating myself.  And a direct confrontation with the forces of the Wendigo would be suicide anyway.  (it has the numbers, the money, the guns, and if I am honest it also has many people smarter and more clever than me.) 
So how to defeat the Wendigo?  Ultimately, I think that its limitless greed and hunger will cause it to devour itself.  But it is doing such damage to everything else on its way to self-destruction that simply letting things run their course is not something I am willing to do.      So I guess it is time to research, meditate and pray on how to turn the Wendigo’s strengths and limitless greed against itself.  Find a way to help the Wendigo dissolve into the void far sooner than it would naturally.

Thank you John, I find your posts really thought-provoking (I’ve been thinking about archetypes all week). I wonder if you could expand a bit on how churches used to collect and then use energy – was this built into the liturgy somehow? You mention writings that discuss this – is there anything you’d recommend reading?







 Jenxyz says: 



								August 15, 2018 at 3:27 pm							




No limits: i read Dion Fortune’s text and thought about how similar it seems to Edgar Cayce’s body of work. From an academia point of view, in the past, one solution to jobs going offshore was to have everyone acquire health care skills: certified nurse assistant, licensed practical nurse, just the entry level to ensure employment. Now I think everyone should know how to build themselves a dwelling: we have the milestone of acquiring a driver license, why not include a “builder license” instead? Dwellings come from our forefathers Masonic tools: plumb bob, Square, apron, trowel. 
Commenting further on education systems, I’ve read recently that a student can have a $45 tablet and learn advanced reading, perhaps writing, and arithmetic. This as the state of Colorado switches to a four-day school week. If you can pass the SAT, so be it. If you can pass the Medical College Entrance Exam (MCAT), good on ya.

“Notice here one of the fundamental principles of esoteric philosophy: creation requires limitation. To bring something into being is to accept limits.”  
Not just esoteric philosophy – it’s common logical sense that Creation implies Form, and Form implies limits, i.e. the boundaries between whatever-it-is and whatever-it-isn’t. 
This being an essential underlying theme for any Christian theodicy, it’s encouraging to hear that Dion Fortune made the point too.  All wisdom must reject the monist mush which you amusingly term “pop spirituality”.

A Central Sun (which since it appears we’re leaping exuberantly between astronomy and physics metaphors, we might also call a nucleus), from which building blocks made of paired entwined helices diffuse outward and interact to form more complex structures… this part sounds oddly familiar!
(The analogy is imperfect and only seems to hold within a small portion of the overall picture. Still, I wonder what Dion Fortune would have thought of her Dipolar Notional Atoms having such a close biochemical parallel.)

Re: the implications of movement –> light –> sound
I thought immediately of animals in the sea, communicating. Fish dance to communicate over short distance, to specific individuals, usually. Almost all creatures move, for their own basic needs to eat, mate, escape, catch, instinctively.
Adding light displays, they can communicate greater complexity, and very quickly – octopus or deep sea creatures flashing complex information about moods, prey and mating status. Without obstruction, light also travels far, and purely. Fewer animals do this. this. Anyone with eyes can see your light, even if they don’t know exactly what it means. But it is easy to block with matter in the way.
But creatures that are very far apart, with coral atolls and plankton clouds in the way, they sing, long deep songs. Blue whales are the prime example ( on land giraffe and elephant rumble like this through the ground,too). Whales have language and dialect and ritual. Whale song can travel much farther, but slowly, and can be harder to perceive without having the right hearing apparatus, and other sounds can interfere more easily, because of the length of time between messenger and receiver; changes in the medium vibrating may also alter the sound, and subtly the message.







 Joel says: 



								August 15, 2018 at 5:02 pm							




>In physics, movement doesn’t create light … except in certain jerry-rigged instances.
Motion producing light was actually rusky-rigged: Pavel Cherenkov won the 1958 Nobel Prize for demonstrating it, although a limey (Oliver Heaviside, he of the famous step function) did the math to show how a while before. The effect is very much like a sonic boom, but in a dielectric medium rather than an acoustic one.
If you aren’t being super strict in interpreting her words, though, the principle of changes to more-concrete oscillations (like the electron orbitals that give atoms their volume) giving rise to less-concrete oscillations (like photons) is fairly general in physics, and can be observed in quite a few contexts.

Fortune’s comment about divine trinities being based on the triple rings caught my attention before I could even get into pondering the discs and rays, and my medication today was focused on which part of the Christian trinity would be linked to which ring. Based on the order in which they arise, Father/Son/Spirit would correspond to Cosmos/Chaos/Pass-Not. I thought this seemed odd at first – the “evil” ring linked to Jesus, the most explicitly merciful, generous, and compassionate of the persons of the Trinity. But the more I reflected, the more sense it made.
The Son, after all, is also the only member of the Trinity to die, and his death and resurrection could be seen as an allegory for the process of created things being drawn out to the edge of existence, dissolving, and then passing back into creation. He defeats death by submitting to it, just as Fortune says that one destroys evil by refusing to anchor it with resistance. 
This perspective suggests that Christ’s role in Creation is as a disruptive force preventing stagnation and accretion – appropriate for a revolutionary messianic figure who preached against the accumulation of wealth and exhorted his followers to “hate the world”. As Fortune says, the Ring-cosmos would become rigid and static without the Ring-Chaos pulling against it. As the Logos, he creates by separation: to name something is to distinguish it from other things. The association with the ring of the Devil is hinted at in the Qabala, where “Moschiach” is equivalent in Gematria to “Nachash”, the Serpent of Eden who causes mankind to be cast outward from the unchanging comfort of paradise.
The rituals of Christianity can thus be seen as techniques to harness the force of the Ring-Chaos and apply it carefully to the human soul as a purifying agent, “meeting hate with hate” as Fortune prescribes in order to banish the sin that obscures humankind’s view of God. Rather than denying one’s sins, and so locking them in place by resistance, one confesses them, allowing them to dissolve in the blood of the sacrificial Lamb.

Dear JMG.
I have been meditating in your “Law of limits”, here you come at it again in this comment of the cosmic doctrine!
I am afraid this text of Dion Fortune is way “out of my league”, but still I wait eagerly for your monthly post and I am starting to read the book not trying to understand it (beyond the literal words), but to allow it to make movies in my head. For those like myself with very little education and interest in art or music, always prioritizing the analytic part of the brain, it is a challenging but exciting experience.
God bless you!

JMG,
When I read the description of the Rays, I got a different image than what you depict in the blog post. My edition of the Cos Doc states of the Rays that they “must be thought of in pairs, each one being in special association with its opposite number, so that the true movement is a figure 8 [depicted in my text as a figure 8 on its side, looks like the infinity symbol], the outgoing flow being above in one half of the circle, and below in the opposite half.”
So the image I got was all the Rays going out on one surface of the disc, as you put it like the surface of a vinyl record, from the center to the periphery in the same direction and all coming back on the opposite surface all in the same direction toward the center and crossing as they reach the center to form the figure 8 symbol on its side. All Rays on one surface are moving from the center outward, and all Rays on the other surface are moving from the periphery to the center, then crossing to the other surface at the Central Sun, which in my mind increases tremendously the power of the center and where, as Fortune states, “the synthesis of all the forces, and the balancing of them” happens. (If I can figure out how to develop a graphic image of what I am talking about, I will post a link to it.)
Anyway, it so happens that yesterday I was soaking in an herb bath and musing on the movement of the Rays, developing the image of them in my mind, seeing them, then starting to feel them, and suddenly I realized that I was seeing the attraction of male and female to each other, the polarity of attraction as I imagined a Ray coming toward me, turning, and heading back to the imagined other, and a Ray leaving him and heading toward me, the Rays crossing in the space between us, arriving, turning again and heading back, a movement that set up an oscillation of energy. This image was quite profound and revealing to me of the energies of sexual attraction. And I realized today when I read your blog post that the crossing of the Rays as they circulated from me to him and him to me created the “Central Sun” between us which in this context I interpret now as representing the relationship formed between two people. The relationship is a third entity created from the polarities and the movement of the Rays. And the relationship, symbolized by the Central Sun image, is the synthesis and the balancing of the forces of attraction between male and female. (And I realize writing this that the metaphor could extend to a multitude of different beings, bodies, situations…)
When I first read this chapter, I had a rather ho-hum response, so I read it a couple more times but didn’t start to get a true feel for the concepts until my epiphany yesterday in the bathtub compounded by your explication today.
Thank you!
Yanocoches

Does the metaphor for the ring cosmos carry through to the readings that astrologers use to let us know what will occur and how we can perceive and act in accordance with the cosmic movements?  There seems to be congruence between the spinning rings and time, the universe containing the celestial bodies and the metaphor that astrological readings for individuals and the movements of space,  and their metaphorical effects upon individuals.  We all start our infinitesimally tiny spans of existence at slightly different times so our metaphoric positions in the ring cosmos are unique. 
As concerns limitations, I once had a course in expository writing given by a rather brilliant professor, Larry Sullivan.  In this course we learned how to limit the topic, concentrate upon and use the didactic method to get our points across, and create an essay that gets our points across.  During that course I wrote an essay about the hierarchical structure of the universe.  It was sophomoric, the explanation being that the cosmos at the time was supposedly doughnut shaped, so using that shape I expounded upon what it’d be like to be part of a real gigantic doughnut in the next higher realm.  I discussed briefly what would happen if a being in this larger world ate the part of the doughnut we were in, and included speculations and probabilities concerning this.  It’s from this course that the concepts of limitlessness [diffusion of the metaphorical movement] and limitation [Which gives the metaphor power and cohesion] are very real to me. 
I will watch to see how I am reacting to the phases of the moon, and the day!  What cool concepts.

David, glad to hear it. Our culture is so fixated on notions of endless expansion into emptiness — see the religious emotions that have gathered around the idea of space travel for a good example! — that it takes a leap of mind to realize just how useful and necessary limits are, and how they empower us. 
Yanocoches, no question, there were a lot of loudly publicized schools in those days that were basically cash cows for the people who ran them. The better grade of occult school asked for a modest membership fee — basically, enough to pay a share of the overhead for the school itself — and a lot of teachers, Fortune among them, pointed out that when you’re asked to pay lots of money for occult instruction, you’re being fleeced. 
Yorkshire, an excellent metaphor! The answer is yes — one of the benefits of discursive meditation is that it allows you to extract much more from a given set of occult practices. 
Danae, fascinating. I haven’t read that — will see if the local library system has a copy. 
David, glad to hear it. Yeah, I try not to waste prose — and this seemed like a project that needed to be done. 
Dewey, square on the mark. The equivalent of the New Moon is the spring equinox; you set things in motion in the spring, you bring them to completion in the summer, you harvest and sort things out in the fall, and you leave things fallow in the winter. 
Imbrium, you’re most welcome. Those vortices would make great themes for meditation!
Katherine, to my mind, it’s because Bach worked within very strict forms that his music is so good. As Gyorgi Doczi pointed out in The Power of Limits, beauty is the product of energy interacting with limitation, and the greatest beauty comes from very high energies interacting with very strict limits. 
Coboarts, that’s one way to construct a metaphor, but it’s not the one Fortune is using; see if you can figure out, by “thinking through” her metaphors, why she chose to picture it the way that she did. As for Ahrimanic and Luciferian evil, that distinction comes into being later on in the process — we’ll get there in due time. 
Millicently, you’re welcome and thank you. As for the way that actions in one mode can trigger other actions in different modes, have you ever ridden in the kind of car that, once you push it above a certain speed, starts to vibrate? The action of driving down the road (movement) sets up rhythmic patterns in the car (sound) that, pushed far enough, can actually damage the car. 
Jim, you’re almost there. What do you do instead of opposing something? Empower its opposite. Don’t fight the Wendigo, figure out which forces move in the other direction, and strengthen those, starting with yourself and working out from there. Don’t participate in the Wendigo consciousness yourself — that means, for example cutting way back on your own consumption — and try to open up gaps between the Wendigo and the things you care about, in as many ways as you can, so that it meets less resistance and does less damage in its inevitable rush outward to the Void. 
Squalembrato, good. You’re paying attention. 
James, sure. Let’s imagine a church service; you’ve got the congregation in their pews and the priest at the altar. The priest goes through a prescribed set of words and actions which stir the emotions of the congregation, and they pour out their emotional energy toward the altar in response. If the priest knows what he’s doing, he’s going through a series of inner activities at the same time, which direct those energies along specific channels; there are also spiritual beings — “angels” is the usual term in Christian practice — who assist with the handling of the energy. At the peak of the service, the flows of energy reach a crescendo and extend “upwards” (metaphorically) to the god who is worshiped in the church, and the god responds with a “downward” flow of power, which depending on your denomination may be embodied in the Communion wafer or simply stream out over the congregation, and through them into the world. That’s the whole point of a Sunday service. As for books, I read a bunch of them back in the day but it’s been a very long time; the one I still have, which is kind of idiosyncratic but interesting, is C.W. Leadbeater’s The Science of the Sacraments. 
Jenxyz, sure, but you’ll have to figure out a way around the very popular habit of using control over real estate to parasitize off other people. That can be done, but it’s going to take some work and some serious changes. 
Robert, well, Dion Fortune was a Christian — a distinctly odd sort of Christian, but a regular communicant at her local Anglican church, and the author of a very well-regarded work on Christian mysticism, Mystical Meditations on the Collects — so it’s not surprising that she would get that! As for “monist mush” — a nice label, that — I probably should do a post on that one of these days. The difficulty with pop-culture monism is that it mistakes half of a truth for the whole truth; of course that’s where most of the really ghastly mistakes come from…
Walt, I wish she’d lived into the era of the new biology — I think she would have done a lot with it. 
SaraDee, hmm! I wouldn’t have thought of that, but it’s a fine metaphor. 
Joel, interesting. I don’t have a background in physics, so didn’t know that. Thank you. 
Phil, glad to hear it. I’d gladly down an ale with the rest of you if I could! 
Fred, fascinating. Yes, that does make sense, doesn’t it? 
Kfish, welcome to occult philosophy. No question, it’s hard work. 
Elodie, thank you! When you “allow it to make movies in your head,” you’re doing exactly what Fortune wants you to do, and training your mind through the metaphorical images she presents. Keep at it, and you’ll find that the ideas will start to make more sense. 
Yanocoches, yes, that’s what I thought early on in my reading, too. Notice, though, the words right after the infinity symbol: “…the outgoing flow being above in one half of the circle, and below in the opposite half.” So the figure 8 isn’t to be taken quite that literally. 
Larry, yep. Astrology is among other things what happens to these vast and relatively simple Cosmic cycles when we get down to the scale of a single individual on a single planet in a single solar system. As for limitation as a tool in writing, dear gods, yes — half the reason most people have trouble writing well is that they try to write about too much, and so are reduced to vague floundering. Focus and limitation are essential there!

So…things can get diffused into the void? But I thought nothing can get past the ring pass-not. Yet I see the ring chaos is outside of it…so the universe leaks? If the ring chaos generates forces…and they tend to diffuse toward the unmanifest …and the ring chaos is outside of the pass-not, then how does evil affect us?

“One point of the metaphor—there are others—is that movement, color, and sound comprise the three primary tools of the operative mage, and are combined in even the simplest magical working.”
Am I on the right track if I connect movement, color, and sound to Druid concepts of nwyfre, gwyar, and calas?  Meaning, movement is the source or life force (nwyfre), color represents the fluidity of change towards one state or another (gwyar) like movement through the spectrum, and sound is the densest, most palpable form (calas).  I know we’re not supposed to be so literally scientific with CosDoc, but I find it notable that sound in general is a slower moving energy wave, with bass sounds being the most penetrating, heavy, and hard to manage because of their big wave pattern.  Every operative mage, from what I have come to understand as I study your system of Druid magic, begins with an intention/movement/nwyfre, follows this with a magical ritual/color/gwyar, inevitably changing consciousness on the material plane/sound/calas.  
Fortune features a recap where she ominously warns “You will meet these numbers again.”  Oh dear.  I tried to understand this section through my own unfortunate sneezing.   I would like to share my analogy if it is at all helpful to anyone:
Cosmic anatomy of a sneeze:
1. Irritation/Histamine… Ring
2. Sneeze… Manifest
3. Wiping nose… Evolution
4. Intersects with conscious thought… Form
5.  The choice to prevent more sneezing with self-care or the choice to ignore sneezing and face unknown consequences of ignoring whatever is causing the sneeze… Life

Hi John Michael,
It is nice that things are quieter this week. Oh boy, did you take us places last week! 🙂
The human population on the continent recently passed 25 million. The day it was announced I heard a news report where a lady breathlessly proclaimed that the potential population on this continent was unlimited because, well the reason given was that human innovation was unlimited. Of course such claims fail many tests, but you know when I heard the lady speak, she really believed the claim. I later searched for the audio but have been unable to find it (not that I searched very hard for it as I’m busy on other things).
Interestingly, I note that light is often part of Christian motifs and I guess that there is no coincidence there.
I have a sneaking suspicion that light in the context that you wrote about, can also be the source for a local paradigm.
Cheers
Chris

Onething, things within the Ring-Pass-Not don’t actually go out into the void. They simply dissolve into their most basic energies and are absorbed into the formless swirling energies of the Ring-Cosmos. We’ll be getting into that in more detail in later chapters. 
Kimberly, good! Making such connections is a good habit if it helps you expand your understanding of the text. 
Chris, I hope she doesn’t have to learn just how wrong she is by way of any of the really ghastly things that happen when a continent gets lethally overpopulated…

JMG
Darkest Yorkshire has hit on an intriguing metaphor with heat engines (conversion of heat energy into kinetic energy / movement / electricity) and with methods to increase the efficiency of the conversion: quote: “Makes me wonder if there’s a magic equivalent of CCHP and quadgeneration that wring every last drop of work out of it.” Seems from your JMG reply, there is.
I looked up quadgeneration and got this https://patents.justia.com/patent/9035482
Now this design is all about discs, action and reaction, and limits, and a new and different design compared with the Nikolas Tesla ‘disc’ turbine of yesteryear. I note in passing that Nikolas Tesla had something of a cult following among New Age folk who included a research engineer friend of mine a decade or so ago. 
The above is a bit by-the-way but is intro to a thought on the way metaphors have been put to work in language in modern times. It is a commonplace that the mechanical clock came to dominate a model of meaning in the Clockwork Universe (apparently Newton actually did not like the comparison because it left God out of it). But the concept of ‘force’ applied to purpose still lingers, and we have the ubiquitous ‘energy’ applied to thoughts and to personality and to co-ordinated or synchronised group thinking and so on. We recognise ‘energy’ as an attribute. 
And latterly there is much talk of computers.  It occurs to me that historically these concepts were not available. Thus, perhaps, in earlier times attributes of personality were more likely to provide close metaphors when vocabulary was needed to ascribe meaning. I think also of breath or wind or other poetic simile recruited for metaphor. These earlier terms of course use the direct experience of events that are already part of the stuff of mind.
So light, colours, sound comprise the ur-language of the mind. Seems reasonable to me.

JMG…
I’m a little confused by your Ray Motion Diagram. When I grappled with the visualizations for this section, and re-read the text I came to a pretty unambiguous view of the rays as all rotating in the “same” direction. 
I did a hasty revision of your image to describe what I was seeing in my minds eye and posted it here: http://7goldfish.com/public_files/RayMotionRev.png & here: http://7goldfish.com/public_files/RayMotionFig8.png
I’m not sure where I went wrong with this, as it would allow for the “figure 8 motion” that was described here:
“Now these Rays, these circular Rays, which are reflected back from the Ring-Pass-Not, must be thought of in pairs, each one being in special association with its opposite number, so that the true movement is a figure of eight, the out-going flow being above in one half of the circle, and below in the opposite half.”
I assumed that the “circle” referred to was the circle of the ray.
This also has the interesting property that the cosmos-sphere has one half that is tending to be sucked into the central sun, and one have that is tending to be expelled. 
I also spent a great deal of time trying to figure out if the “hubs” of each of the rays landed within the 4th of the “Great rings” 
Also, thanks so much for these posts, they are very helpful.

Fascinating!  I was refreshing myself with “projection of the shadow” and noticed there are a lot of striking similarities between Jung’s ideas of this and what we’ve been learning from The Cosmic Doctrine.  The conscious and the unconscious being similar to ring-cosmos and ring-chaos, and I am guessing reality itself being the ring-pass-not, and then realizing we go on a constant back and forth between the conscious and unconscious, always changing ourselves so that our psyche doesn’t become static.  I honestly didn’t make the connection before that the ideas in The Cosmic Doctrine would be useful in helping to explain who we are on a personal level.  It also all lends further credence to the idea that Jung was more of an occultist than a scientist.

“I’m not sure how many people realize that the decrease in miracles and the increase in sexual scandals among clergy have the identical cause, but from the point of view of occult philosophy, it’s obvious.” 
*slaps forehead*  Of course it is! (Now that you’ve pointed it out!)
“..movement, color, and sound comprise the three primary tools of the operative mage, and .. activity of one form can cause activity in other forms…”
A few months ago I ran across an article depicting bird songs visualised as flowers.  The link below isn’t the one I originally read, but it gives the general idea.  During a meditation just after this, I had a vision of birds “singing” flowers into their shapes, each bird having a particular resonance for a particular flower.  Exhilarating, and not easily put into words, but it suggested to me that magery may not only be practiced by humans. 
https://designawards.core77.com/Visual-Communication/30854/Chirming
Come to think of it, some of these images are not unlike Rays radiating from centre to circumference and returning to centre again – although not always in a count of Twelve.
“The period between the New Moon and the First Quarter is favorable for beginning anything new; the period between the First Quarter and the Full Moon is favorable for strengthening and consolidating things; the period between the Full Moon and the Last Quarter is favorable for making changes; the period between the Last Quarter and the New Moon is favorable for ending and letting go.”  
Now this description rings true for me, in the most practical way, as “tuning in” the four phases of a menstrual cycle is the central clinical work in the TCM approach to functional infertility that is attributable (either partly or wholly) to the physiology of the woman.  
The First Menstrual Phase is a new beginning as a new egg is selected to ripen in the ovary.  The Second Menstrual Phase is for strengthening and consolidating the egg.  The Third Menstrual Phase (begins at ovulation) is favourable for making changes – fertilisation, movement of blastocyst and implantation, all active processes, may take place during this phase.  The Fourth Menstrual Phase, is, of course favourable for ending and letting go with the period flow, UNLESS, the activity during the Third Menstrual Phase has switched the whole Cycle over into the First Pregnancy Phase (which means new beginnings in a larger and different cycle) instead.   The “tuning” process means tailoring each week’s treatment (and also advice) to match the phases, almost exactly as you have described them here!
Thanks for many new things to think about.
And, if I may? As I’ve missed the window of opportunity…

Robert, that was how I read it, so no worries. I’m not sure if you get this sort of thing on your side of the pond, but over here certain kinds of spirituality are very much a part of pop culture — an embarrassingly large number of people take up yoga or mindfulness meditation the way they get the latest hair style or go to the hot new vacation resort town, because it’s fashionable and all their friends are doing it. 
Phil H, that’s an excellent point, If computers are around long enough, we may see metaphors based on them becoming as important to popular thought as steam and hydraulic metaphors have done. 
Will, ding! We have a winner. My advice to aspiring poets writing in English has always been to master the sonnet form — not just fourteen lines of iambic pentameter with a certain rhyme scheme, but also the way that the first eight lines present a certain view of things and then the final six put in a twist that redefines it. If you can write a good sonnet, you can write pretty much any kind of poetry well, including free verse —  but if all you do is free verse, your odds of being able to write any kind of poetry except the Vogon type are pretty low. 
Jim, good. Very good. 
Harry, the line you quoted seems to me to support the diagram as I’ve drawn it — “the outgoing flow” being the flow outward from the Central Sun, which goes above the disk on one side of the disk and below the disk on the other. I relate that to the way that the disk of the Ring-Cosmos is attracted toward the upper arc of the Ring-Chaos on one side and repelled by it on the other, causing the Ring-Cosmos to rotate: the outgoing flow, being drawn outward by the influence of the Ring-Chaos, is attracted to it, while the incoming flow, being drawn in by the influence of the Ring-Cosmos, is repelled by the Ring-Chaos. 
That said, of course, there’s only one person who can explain exactly what Dion Fortune meant when she wrote those lines, and she’s resting comfortably in a cemetery in Glastonbury these days, so if your interpretation works for you, by all means pursue it. 
Prizm, hmm! I hadn’t thought of that comparison at all, but of course you’re quite correct. I should probably fast-track my post on Jung as an occultist…
Scotlyn, you’re most welcome. It’s a very rich text with a lot of things that can be unpacked from it. Many thanks for the birdsong flowers — those are fascinating!

If the 3 rays, 7 circles/planes, and 12 rays correspond to the 3 (non-Earth) elements, 12 zodiacal signs, and 7 astrological planets assigned to the 22 paths (or rather, to paths 11 through 32) of the Tree  — which is what I’m assuming you were referring to — then is an interaction between zodiac signs (rays) and  planets (circles/planes) which somehow creates the tangential atoms, or am I pressing the correspondences too far?  How does this symbolism of the rings and the planes and the rays tie in with the Tree generally?

Phil, that turbine is an interesting sounding thing and good metaphor fuel but I don’t know enough engineering or physics to be able to visualise it without drawings. I actually meant something else by quadgeneration though. This is a good site about the systems I had in mind https://www.clarke-energy.com/news/. The ‘Power’ section shows the different things that can be done with generators to make them more efficient. The section ‘Gas Types’ also has a lot of interesting information about several different industries.
I’ve spent time thinking about how other thermodynamic concepts could apply to spirituality – particularly whether spiritual changes and development could be described as adiabatic, isothermal, isochoric, isobaric, isoenthalpic…the whole family of iso- prefixes. I was reading Robert Thurman’s Inner Revolution and when he said that in Tibetan lore enlightenment is accompanied by a bright flash of light I thought “Does that mean enlightenment is an exothermic reaction?” That led to spending a while wondering where that energy would come from, whether it increases the amount of energy in the body, and the possibility that it’s not directly enlightenment but accumulated spiritual gunk being incinerated and returned to the cycle by the process of enlightenment. I also wondered if in contrast Zen enlightenment would be isothermal. It sounds very Zen. 🙂

Re: poetic form
Actually, in my humble opinion as non-English speaker and non-poet, I think haikus are much too easy in English because there are so many monosyllables! You can easily write a line composed of five monosyllables. In Japanese they seem to be more limiting (and therefore perhaps more fruitful) because there, you often can’t avoid polysyllabic words. Vice versa with rhyme, which may be too easy in Japanese (and Latin, and Ancient Greek) and is therefore not so appreciated in classical poetry. Actually, what we call rhyme was regarded as unfelicitous diction in classical Latin and Greek poetry and only came in use through popular Christian poets.
Which is to say, yes, the more limiting the better 🙂 ! Scaldic meters like King Harald’s last poem at Stamford Bridge make your head spin…

Following on the collective power of a church train of thought, I get the sense that perhaps it’s best to NOT join a church (grove, coven…) until I, as an individual, am spiritually prepared to participate in group power workings.
That goes directly against what we’re taught as Christains growing up – that the church is there to nurture and foster spiritual growth in members of its congregation from the cradle on – and hints at something, well, let’s be kind, something slightly less philanthropic.
Ive had this craving to join a druid grove for years now, if for no other reason than fellowship and guidance, but now I see that maybe that’s not the best way to go. That I need to become a little more me before I can really become we.
At the same time, I now realize that you have basically demonstrated for us how a “church” is supposed to work, with you in the e-pulpit and the rest of us as your e-congregation. You feed your creative process with our energy, and return power to us through your insights, writings, and personal guidance. 
So maybe, in a sense, I’m already part of a church, even if it’s a rather idiosyncratic one…
Is that off the mark?







 Kay Robison says: 



								August 16, 2018 at 4:54 pm							




Hi JMG,
Yanocoches, yes, that’s what I thought early on in my reading, too. Notice, though, the words right after the infinity symbol: “…the outgoing flow being above in one half of the circle, and below in the opposite half.” So the figure 8 isn’t to be taken quite that literally. 
I read your commentary about the circulation of the rays first before reading the CD text and and your graphic seemed very reasonable.  When I read the CD text about the ways the rays traveled, I got confused, but the idea of a figure 8 made more sense as I tried to visualize the motion.  Now your response to Yanocoches has me really confused.  Just asking, but it seems to me that this motion should be illustrated perhaps as two smaller circles and that the motion comes up from the center, travels to the outer edge, dives under towards the center and then comes up again completing the circuit.  Otherwise to me it seems as if there are two directions in relationship to the center, as the rays travel from one edge to the other wither on top or bottom.  Is my assumtion that the rays originate from the center incorrect?
Thanks

Please excuse this question if you’ve already answered this somewhere or if it is ridiculously elementary – this is challenging going for someone (me) who has always struggled with anything abstract.  The days and nights referenced above, are they literal, 24-hour days and nights or do they represent much longer periods of time – or do they not represent actual time as we think of it at all?  
Thank you for the diagrams, they are making it a bit easier to understand.  Creating illustrations in my mind in order to understand concepts is how I got through school; when I went to college to study to be a translator, I visualized all the foreign languages and syntax I was learning by moving words and pictures around in my head.  I’m a bit out of practice, though.







 Yanocoches says: 



								August 16, 2018 at 5:33 pm							




@ Harry Pottash, thank you for the diagrams. The second image is the way I have envisioned the Rays in a figure 8 movement except I would have put the outgoing current on the top for some reason. (But it probably doesn’t matter in space, right?)
JMG,
Thank you for the discussion. Like Harry Pottash, I interpreted the “circle” to refer to the circle made by the Rays as they travel around the ring. I went back to the first chapter for the description of the Ring Cosmos as it gets moving. I never visualized the Ring Cosmos as have one polarity on each side but being half and half. The first chapter says:
“Now the first circle must be conceived of as having an upper and a lower surface. The upper surface of the *outflowing* arc may be conceived of as positive, and the lower negative. The reverse being the case in the *inflowing* arc.”  (emphasis with asterisks mine) So as I see it, the upper surface is positive on the way out and negative on the return, making the surface half positive and half negative. Same then would be true for the lower surface, only the opposite polarity. So the sides of the disc formed from the Ring Cosmos are not of a uniform polarity but half positive and half negative.
This makes more sense to me as a way to describe how the dynamic of the spin via attraction and repulsion to and from the Ring Chaos happens. The positive half of the upper surface lifts up and is attracted to the Ring Chaos.  This attraction happens in both halves, the positive half of the lower surface is attracted to the bottom half arc of the Ring Chaos. Once the positive halves pass their respective arcs of the Ring Chaos, the negative halves take over and cause the repulsion of the Ring Cosmos away from the Ring Chaos. This would set up a sure, one directional spin. Once the disc reaches the 90 degree angle, because of being repulsed by the negative sides, the positive aspects take over again, the upper positive surface, now the lower, heading toward the bottom half of the Ring Chaos and the lower positive surface, now the upper, heading toward the top half of the Ring Chaos.
I wish I had the computer graphics skills to be able to make a computer image for what I am seeing. And I hope my verbal description makes some sort of sense. I can see this and feel this so clearly… and actually used my lunch plate today to make a moving example for myself just to make sure. (Got crumbs everywhere.)

 John Michael Greer says: 



								August 16, 2018 at 6:44 pm							




David, sounds like a great set of themes for meditation. 😉
Matthias, there are also two other things at work in a classical haiku in Japanese. First, there must always be some kind of seasonal reference, however subtle; second, the poem is structured so that one of the words (the “hinge word”) can be read in two different ways, with two different meanings. (Japanese has a lot of homonyns, and haiku are always written in the kana syllabary rather with the kanji ideographs, to make it possible to play off both meanings). So it’s an extremely demanding form with strict limits, which is one of the reasons that so many of the greatest poems in Japanese have been written in it or the closely related waka form. 
Tripp, if it’s done honestly it can actually benefit anyone who’s willing to participate in it. One of the secrets of the life force is that the more flows out of you, the more flows into you — so if you spend every Sunday at church pouring out emotional energy, and it’s being handled by someone who knows what he or she is doing, you go away feeling refreshed and revivified. Another is that if you’re doing this in cooperation with a god, there’s a return flow of energy from the divine to the human which can be very intense and very beneficial. On the other hand, you get churches and other religious bodies which have become corrupt and predatory, where you’re just being used for your energy and there is no return flow from the divine — you get the benefits of increased flow, but there are various costs as well. 
As for the virtual Church of Ecosophia, yes, we’re basically doing the same kind of working on the mental rather than the astral and etheric planes. That’s also very common, and so far it seems to be working well. 
Kay, yes, they originate from the center, but they don’t dive through the center to the other side when they pass through the center. 
Beekeeper, I should have explained that, shouldn’t I? “Days and Nights of Manifestation” is a bit of terminology much used in occultism, and it refers to vast cycles of time, billions of years in length, during which entire universes come into being, work through their life cycles, and go out of existence again. 
Yanocoches, exactly — and the division of the disk of the Ring-Cosmos into positive and negative halves is exactly reflected in the division of the Rays, six of them going outward from the Central Sun on the upper surface and six of them going outward on the lower surface.







 Will J says: 



								August 16, 2018 at 7:11 pm							




Matthias,
I agree that a haiku is too lax,
At least the way it’s done most times here.
They do it different in Japan, relax*,
So if you’ll be kind, and give me your ear:
There must be a reference to a season,
And a pun of some sort or another.
And thus like our host says, for that reason
I think a Japanese haiku is a bother.
To write, at least, but to read there are none
I like better than a haiku well done.
*not meant to be insulting, but needed for rhyme.

Thank goodness the rays are within the plane of the Ring Cosmos!
When I read the text, I was envisioning the 12 rays projecting into the 3 dimensional space of the Ring-Pass-Not, like rays drawn from the vertices of an icosahedron to its center!
From here on out, does all the action of the rays and their tangentials and prime atoms occur within the plane of the Ring Cosmos, or will there be structures above and below it?
I remember, from the old blog, that you mentioned that a man and a woman who were attracted to each other sexually, yet who had good reasons never to consummate the attraction, could make use of that power for magical workings.   I am beginning to see the context for those workings in Dion Fortune’s writings.

About the Church discussion-does this mean that a church with a more conservative liturgy-say, 1928 Prayerbook Anglican, Tridentine Mass Catholic, or Eastern Orthodox (who never really went in for liturgical modernism) would handle the energies raised by the service better? Those types of churches always felt more natural and, well, holy to me-especially when compared to your typical megachurch that can’t decide if its having a Sunday service or a rock concert!







 Matthias Gralle says: 



								August 17, 2018 at 5:48 am							




Thanks about the haiku! I don’t speak any Japanese, so only suspected there was more to it than the syllable count (Genji somewhere mentions that his generation prefers other seasonal references than did bygone poets).







 Tripp says: 



								August 17, 2018 at 6:37 am							




So according to the rules of haiku, my offering from 2 weeks ago was better than I thought:
Wharton set the stage
to wax poetic all day
Return brevity!
There’s the seasonal reference. In fact a full annual cycle of them.
“Set the stage” fits your description of Spring perfectly.
Both “wax” and “all day” suggest the long days of summer.
And “Return brevity!” is an obvious cry from Autumn for the return of Winter. (I rather long for cooler weather by this time of year, living in the humid South without AC…)
“Wax” is the pivot word, meaning either growing/increasing, or hardening/preserving. It’s not exactly in the center, but does it have to be?
To satisfy Matthias, there’s not an overabundance of monosyllables – 7 of 17 seems reasonable, plus 2 dubs and 2 trips, the 2 most complex words being “poetic” and “brevity,” which convey the entire meaning of the poem by themselves as a bonus.
Apologies if this wanders too far afield or comes off as too self-congratulatory. It shouldn’t be, since someone else clearly wrote this haiku through me!

Hi John Michael,
It is certainly possible that hard lessons will be learned. Water is the limiting factor down here, next I’d have to suggest that the old soils won’t stand for too much flogging. But we’ll certainly try and give it a go. 🙂
I was reading Mark Twain’s, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn stories this morning and it occurred to me that he writes with a local voice. As I wondered about that, I got to thinking about what you wrote recently about the impact of ‘place’ upon humans, and I had then wondered if Mark Twain was described as the ‘father of American literature’, because he tapped into the local sensibilities which had attuned to the energies of that land, rather than simply aping the work of the Europeans? Dunno.

I’ve finally finished reading the comments of Kek4 (and did that naming convention make anyone else think of Vatican 2?) 🙂 The idea of Europeans wanting One Big Battle has specific historical as well as mythological roots, and is relevant to the question of resisting or getting out of the way of a problem. These days we think of maneuver warfare as the best and most modern form of war, and associate war of attrition with pointless slaughter in the trenches of WW1. War of maneuver was actually practised earlier by medieval mercenary armies who weren’t keen on dying, and who profited the longer the war went on. War of attrition was developed in the early modern and modern eras by nationalist and revolutionary armies that regarded high casualties as an acceptable price to pay for a quick and decisive victory. So in that sense it could be said dancing around the problem made it go on a lot longer (see: The Hundred Years War). 🙂

A question and an observation…
Are the rays like rays of light (you’re either in them or out of them and if the latter their effect is minimal) or more like fields (in that their influence decreases as you leave their center but tapers rather than dropping off suddenly)?
And..the Central Sun must be a powerful and complex place with all those rays coming and going!







 Fred N says: 



								August 17, 2018 at 11:06 am							




JMG, just to make sure I’m understanding right: the “tangentials” are new lines of force generated by the oppositional (i.e. right-angled) interaction between the rays and the seven rings, correct? Or is it a way of referring to the interaction of the rays with the spin of the ring-pass-not?
Also, are “composite” atoms created by multiple tangentials if different angles intersecting, or are they built up from the interactions of “prime” atoms?

” The conscious and the unconscious being similar to ring-cosmos and ring-chaos, ”
I don’t see the mind this way at all. I see the mind more like a big ocean, and our conscious minds are on the surface. The conscious mind has different tasks, but the unconscious mind is with the program of the well being and survival of the entity. Yes, it can sometimes have a different agenda, as it doesn’t engage in falsehood. But in no way could I see the two as having opposite agendas, as the ring cosmos and chaos. To be sure, both of those latter are necessary for balance. They make perfect sense to me as being like the creator, maintainer and destroyer of Hindu theology, and also as being like the law of entropy. But in that last case I have thought for a long time that we are missing an opposite to entropy, a force for order.
The conscious and unconscious minds are all of a piece.

Hmm. I see myself as a monist, although it was years before I put a label to it because I didn’t know. Gee, it is the meaning behind my moniker here. I didn’t learn it from any pop spirituality. It came to me through intuition, deep contemplation.
So it will be interesting to see your take on this if you write about it someday.

Dear JMG;
you wrote to Jim:
Jim, you’re almost there. What do you do instead of opposing something? Empower its opposite. Don’t fight the Wendigo, figure out which forces move in the other direction, and strengthen those, starting with yourself and working out from there. Don’t participate in the Wendigo consciousness yourself — that means, for example cutting way back on your own consumption — and try to open up gaps between the Wendigo and the things you care about, in as many ways as you can, so that it meets less resistance and does less damage in its inevitable rush outward to the Void.
Could you please explain what you mean by “…to open up gaps between the Wendigo and the things you care about,…”
Thank you
Ilona

Darkest Yorkshire,
The possibility that spiritual states correspond to actual brain changes from energy inputs during them is one I have been interested in for some time. I did not understand all of your post unfortunately, but anyway, I believe there is more than just one type of enlightenment. That there could be a flash of light seems plausible, but remember that the light spectrum is wider than visible light and so I think that there can be states which ‘feel’ like light, just as certain spiritual insight is attributed to the 3rd eye being functional, and that might be quite correct even if it wasn’t a flash.
One of the near death experience researchers on children postulates that there are areas of the brain which can be activated, and thus permanently more alive after an NDE. I think this is really an idea whose time has come.  People have some weird idea that spiritual states, or miracles, exist in some realm which has nothing to do with the brain. Yet the brain is involved and has its areas of involvement for all our activities and experiences. And even though the person’s consciousness may have left the body behind, since the body did not die, even the recalling of the intense event could activate the brain. He postulates the right temporal lobe. And some epileptics have intense spiritual experiences at the onset of attacks. Not all do because different areas of the brain are vulnerable to the misfirings of epilepsy.
My opinion about myself is that I had an intense spiritual experience many years ago and it quickened some part of my brain so that I no longer process the same way as before. At the time I was a Russian Orthodox Christian so I attributed it to the Holy Spirit, not least because the whole thing happened due to my reading of a book written by a monk on Mt. Athos, mostly about the Holy Spirit’s role. The introduction by his acolyte was nearly as long as the book and was written in an utterly different and more intellectual style. The combination was powerful. The acolyte explained that the Holy Spirit is the uncreated energies of God. (Ether anyone?) I’ve always found that to be a rich phrase for contemplation and it made sense that the energy that quickened my soul and brain was of this source, me being the bride in the bridal chamber and saying Yes to my ravishment.

Onething,
Your metaphor of the conscious being on the surface and the subconscious being an ocean is great!  It does remind me a bit of a passage from the Bible, something to the effect of one being like a boat on the sea, they could easily be blown and drift about.  Basically being powerless and with no navigational control.
The conscious thus being something perhaps like a boat or anything floating on the surface of the subconscious is a useful tool for how the mind works.  Thinking of the conscious as how you navigate the subconscious, more primal aspect of our being, one would definitely hope to be in a bit more control how they are navigating.  Otherwise, the subconscious, or ocean, could easily be fraught with waves, wind and other navigational hazards (ie; being controlled and overwhelmed by the primal).  So I think this is a great image to have in mind when thinking of how the conscious and subconscious work as one.  I also think this what Fortune had in mind with how the ring-cosmos and ring-chaos work together.  They along with the ring-pass-not are an entity which cannot exist without the other pieces.  When there is no ring-chaos, there is no ring-cosmos nor ring-pass-not.  Then there is only unmanifest.  Ultimately, these are all symbolic ways to visual how things work so that we can better understand them.  Whichever makes the most sense to you, work with it.  I keep getting a better understanding of things by applying them to things I am working with or reading.

E. Goldstein, yes, everything from here on in takes place in the disk of the Ring-Cosmos — and yes, that’s what I (and she) was talking about. 
Kfish, you’re quite right, of course. I’ll make some time to fix that. 
Tolkienguy, yes, having a liturgy that hasn’t been desecrated in the name of the great god Relevance  will do a lot. It’s also important to have an officiant who has the necessary training and experience to direct the energies through the structures of the sacrament, but any reasonably devout person who has adequate experience with prayer and contemplation, and knows the theology of the sacrament being worked, can do what needs to be done if the liturgy is well designed. 
Matthias, neither do I, but I read a lot of books in English about Japanese culture back in the day, courtesy of growing up with a Japanese stepmother. 
Tripp, funny. 
Chris, good heavens. Who calls Twain the father of American literature? That would be Washington Irving, the first American author to make a name for himself in a field other than theology, and who published his first significant work in 1802. 
Yorkshire, fascinating. As I recall, though, the British high command in the First World War was obsessed with the idea that they could force One Big Battle to defeat the Germans, and kept on being frustrated by the fact that the Germans shrugged and kept up the war of attrition. 
Jim, I like that! 
RPC, good question about the Rays; I don’t recall Fortune defining them that exactly. Yes, the Central Sun is a boiling cauldron of energies! 
Fred, the Tangentials are created by the intersections of the Rays and the seven Circles. As for composite atoms, Fortune’s prose isn’t quite clear in this chapter; it could be read either way. We’ll be talking much more about atoms in the next chapter, though, so things may get clarified there. 
Onething, there’s monism and then there’s monism — I suppose that you could say that monism is not all one thing. 😉 Yes, I’ll get into that in the future post. 
Ilona, sure. It’s a metaphorical way of talking about figuring out how to shelter the things you care about from the forces in contemporary life that could otherwise damage those things. For example, I’m acutely aware of the way that contemporary mass media flattens out the thoughts and imaginations of people into a kind of lowest-common-denominator mush; that’s a central reason why I don’t own a television and stay away from mass media generally. I’ve opened up a gap between my mind and imagination, on the one hand, and the mass media on the other, so that the Wendigo-consciousness of the media goes tumbling past without affecting me. 
Kimberly and David, you know, this is turning out to be highly entertaining. I may get around to writing that sonnet yet.

A good non-jerry-rigged example of the 
Movement -> Light -> Sound
line of thinking came to me (through my wife…from whence so many good things come): 
Northern Lights!  (Or Southern Lights for that matter.)
Movement of the solar wind in the ionosphere excites particles that give off light, and when strong/complex enough, those lights will sing a song.  
When I was 26 I got to witness the full show in Spokane, from the overlook above the Spokane River in Brown’s Addition.  Brilliant view to the north.  Magical is the only word needed to describe it.  Absolutely magical.
When I saw them again near God’s River in Manitoba on the eve of my 33rd birthday, it was a great example of not having enough movement to make the light very complex (only white and green, no blue or gold or red or purple), and those weaker/less complex lights in turn sang no song at all.  My brother and father, who had never seen them before, thought they were amazing; having seen the real McCoy myself years earlier, I knew there was a lot of potential that wasn’t manifesting.

So that’s what we set in motion when we started news-fasting in ’06?  And when we got rid of the tele altogether in ’08.  And the flat refusal to own or engage in video games since game consoles came in Atari 2600 varieties.  Putting space between us and the Wendigo…that makes plenty of sense.  Though we didn’t have such a great descriptive term for it until, um, last week?  (Thanks again, Ray!)
And a lot of those choices were made for the well-being of children – whether for me by my parents, or by me for mine.  Children are the ultimate imposition of limits!  Being a parent is a beautiful and powerful thing, but extremely limiting.  
Likewise, in order to manifest beauty and power in our children we must impose limits upon them.  There is a real parenting crisis occurring today because parents refuse to impose limits on their children.  Letting them do whatever they want to do doesn’t make them mature.  Not enfolding them in your arms doesn’t make them strong and independent.  It leaves them feeling adrift and alone.  Borderless and unmanifest.  I fear for a society composed of such amorphous shadow people with no feel for boundaries.

In the King and Blackwood versions of the story, the Wendigo wins decisively; at the end of the Blackwood story, the Indian guide, one of the last survivors of the group that meets the monster, flees, and “the terror of a whole race [drives] him.”  This is not a critter you want to fool around with.  Rick Yancey’s Monstrumologist survives his encounter with the Wendigo.  I am not giving anything away because there are 2 more books in the series.  The Monstrumologist and his assistant, a teenage boy who narrates the stories, survive, but are emotionally scarred.
So, how do you fight off the Wendigo?  All 3 stories suggest you can’t; the Monstrumologist and his assistant survive only because the Wendigo decides to eat other folks, as happens with one character in the King version.  The Wendigo is possessed by hunger; the more it eats, the thinner, and hungrier, it grows.  We can readily see how such an insatiable demon can aptly characterize America’s spiritual sickness.  But as the reader above asked, what can we DO about it?
When I first read about the wendigo (Blackwood’s “The Wendigo”), I thought of a remark Jesus made, that “This kind [of demon] will not come out except by prayer and fasting.”  Since the Wendigo is the incarnation of greed, taking and taking and taking, maybe one could starve it out—fasting, praying, giving.  Although you won’t see that on page or screen because it wouldn’t make a very exciting story!  But if the Wendigo might somehow exist as a diseased part of the national consciousness, who knows?  Enough people working together might just be able to whip that sucker.

On the topic of limits, some more thoughts:
A simple haiku is not good for all:
Sometimes you can tie yourself in a knot,
And, if stuck, under a single style’s thrall,
Be unable to express what you want,
Stuck by the limits you yourself impose.
And yet, without them, there’s no art to flaunt.
Instead, all you get is ordinary prose.
So the trick then is to know what to do,
With the various art forms you know, who knew?

My first poem written in loose Fibonacci Meter. 
1 Life
1 Is
2 Rhythm
3 Patterns form
5 Repeating changing
8 Never twice equal, evolving
13 From chaos ringing the cosmos, manifest new forms.
21 Learning the lessons, of rhythm, harmonies are found, improvising amidst the noise.
34 Dancing routines hiding passion in formality, infinitesimal masked cells. These bodily avatars born, manifesting spirit.
55 A waltz is a waltz, but this dance is never that dance, every step unique, still a waltz. The dance moves forward, a returning to the refrain, stepping between a difference in the dance between those refrains: back, forward, refrain.
89 Dances gathering, as bodies, tiny or sublime, together various dances… and repetitions, similar dances dancing close. Every dance a dancing dancer, every dancer a dance of the infinitesimal. The steps recognized through time by living traditions. Delicate precise, finely honed, are these cherished life traditions, abyss ever close.
55 So forgetful is this world, the multitude of forms vanish, unheard back into the background static eternal, lost to the abyss. Response, nature selected, can… prolong the dancing. Recognition in harmony.
34 Some dances, like gems, last quite long. In crystalline steps repeated time uncountable. The life of lasting mineral, repetitious peace.
21 Evolving patterns, most complex, recognized in life. A new dance springs out of the old.
13 Some quickly go cold, rushing sparks. Torching its own mind.
8 Some can dance around extinction.
5 Quiet grace remains
3 Beautiful
2 Wisdom
1 True
1 Love.
Note that each section can be split into subsections at golden fractions of syllables. For example:
21 Evolving patterns, most complex, recognized in life. A new dance springs out of the old.
=
13 Evolving patterns, most complex, recognized in life.
     5 Evolving patterns
     3 most complex
     5 recognized in life
8 A new dance springs out of the old.
A ‘perfect Fibonacci meter would follow this distinction down to grammatical clause, to syllable count of words, and even to stress; but in practice you just go a could of iterations down from the number. Thus, lines with smaller numbers of syllables are a little more strict, and build to larger ‘lines’ which are more flexible.
My Haiku entry, in honor of Tripp’s repetition of his own poem.
Tripp’s a falling leaf
Enlightening Ray springs through
Hear rustling branches.

JMG — It was Hemingway who said that _Huckleberry Finn_ was the beginning of modern American literature. Since Hemingway was himself in rebellion against most of what made up earlier American literature I would guess that he didn’t think anything before then was of much value.
I much prefer formal poetry to free verse. Have written a few sonnets, a villanelle, and for the First North American Discworld Convention, I wrote a pantoum. Used to do haiku when I was about 12, and read a lot of them in translation. I took a seminar once on literary style in which the professor had us do exercises in taking one author’s work and rewriting it in the style of another–turn a scene from Hemingway into Faulkner, for example. I recommend such exercises to an aspiring writers as a way to see how different authors achieve their effects.

Astonishing lights
Blinking, twinkling, finish soon

With the Days and Nights of Manifestation, I got to thinking about the way civilizations rise and fall.  Just when it feels as though the Wendigo will finally overcome and darkness will destroy everything once and for all, the Ring Cosmos reaches the end of its movement towards the Ring Chaos and flips over to the other side, where it is now being repulsed by the Ring Chaos.  The balance shifts and light starts to return.  Our civilization seems to be right around that inflection point where the flip is made (but on which side?).  More and more people seem to be aware of the destructive and damaging nature of our society, as though the influence of the Ring Chaos is right around that critical point.  Now the tide is changing and people are beginning to think about doing things differently; creating a new kind of society with different characteristics.
Using this model, the darkness can actually never finally destroy everything; it will only build up to that inflection point of almost utter-domination of evilly evilness, and then things will start to change in the opposite direction, back towards the center as the Ring Cosmos begins its movement away from the Ring Chaos.  But then, the cosmos will only be balanced for a brief moment before the spinning ring is overturned again and the whole process starts anew.

Before I got to “What makes this useful is that every smaller cycle in the Cosmos has similar phases,” the diagram made me think of the precessional cycle as 2 sets of days and nights, each day/night around 6,000 years long. You wrote “every” smaller cycle, so I guess this notion applies here?

@Darkest Yorkshire
Thanks for the link. Yes, I am familiar with combined heat and power (CHP) and district heating (DH).
Denmark deployed a lot of localized electricity generation and DH after the first oil shocks in the 70s by using CHP. They used coal in those days as primary fuel and extracted the most they could from the usable heat fraction; that is from hot water circulated to DH when sufficiently above room temperature.
Energy (‘the ability to do work’ by the physics definition) requires a ‘working substance’.  Making from that something more than a metaphor for the workings of the mind, has seemed problematic for me. Physiological processes of course need energy (physics def.) from food and they dissipate heat, (and the brain for example needs a lot of primary fuel consumed at roughly isothermal conditions), and clearly the processes interact with organized output from the ‘mind’ transmitted via electrical phenomena and chemical interaction. The ‘working substance’ of the mind however seems to be signals of recognition (form rather than energy) and is not localized in the brain but a condition of life itself. Life is essentially signaling utilizing form. 
For what it’s worth here is my take on some phenomena of the mind and their ‘energy’. I am using here the terms energy and work as in common parlance and as used for example in alternative ‘energy’ healing.  This ‘energy’ also ‘works’. 
One does experience internally ‘light’, ‘movement’ and ‘sound’ and these might be what I referred to in a comment to JMG as an ‘ur-language’ of the mind.  (The latter is a somewhat arguable concept that I made up). Yes, it was a long time ago, but I remember meditating on ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ and realizing these terms were not adequate. Perhaps in the same meditation  I witnessed internally a complex unwanted aspect of myself resolve into ‘a form’, and then perhaps with a  nudge or a ‘consent’ from ‘me’, drift to a far periphery and dissolve into fragments of ‘light’. This was more than a form of words and there were physiological consequences. DF’s images and your term ‘spiritual gunk’ have reminded me of the occasion. 
There are many phenomena of the mind experienced in an instant. On occasion they seem ‘timeless’ or a-chronic. Smile. Stopping my smoking habit was of such an instant but differed from the’ dissolve-into-light fragments at the periphery’ that I just described. It came as an opportune gift externally through ordinary communication but with my consent changed me of the instant. It left me still ‘a smoker’; just that I no longer smoked. 
I wonder about some actual experiences of starlight – particular stars – and the potential of ‘gifts’ a bit more than metaphorical. I must ask JMG on Magic Monday sometime. I have stories – one good one about Wordsworth and one or two of my own. But this comment is more than a bit long.

Onething, I’n not entirely sure I understood all of my post either. 🙂 It’s a mind stretching exercise where I look up science and engineering concepts, try to understand them as best I can in their own terms, then think about whether this could be a useful metaphor for spiritual of social change. 
In the Tibetan tradition it isn’t the enlightenee who sees the flash of light. People meditated in huts on the sides of hills and people in the towns down in the valleys would see the flash and think “there goes another one”. At one point it was happening so often Buddhism took on a distinct millenarian outlook as people started to wonder how the world might change if a sufficient number of people became enlightened to reach a kind of critical mass. 
What you said about spiritual experiences permenantly changing the brain, there have been many attempts to do that artificially with hallucinogens, trepanation, and various forms of light, sound and electromagnetic stimulation.
JMG, it’s amazing how strong the lure of one big battle is even when the alternative is still a relatively fast and equally effective way of achieving victory. 
In the First World War the high command wanted the breakthrough into the near-mythical ‘open country’ that would end the war at a stroke. What actually finally worked was ‘bite and hold’ where a small piece of territory was attacked, overrun and defended against enemy counterattack, then the process repeated somewhere else. It wasn’t a decisive battle but the process still wrapped things up in relatively short order. It was so effective a strategy the British Army was still using it in the Falklands (where it confused the Argentinians, who were expecting an immediate all-out attack on Port Stanley).
The drive for a big battle appeared again in the Second World War. In 1943 RAF Bomber Command was devastating the Ruhr war industries. Then they accidently started the Hamburg firestorm and the whole effort got distracted by attempts to deliver a ‘knockout blow’, especially to Berlin. It’s now reckoned that if the stranglehold on the Ruhr had continued, the entire Nazi economy would have collapsed sometime in 1944.
It doesn’t have to be full-scale war either. From what I’ve read recently about the 1984-85 Miners’ Strike, there were three or four opportunities for the miners to have won quickly and effectively, but subtly. One was continuing the overtime ban instead of going on strike (although I suspect that would have resulted in the power stations burning oil to preserve coal stocks as they did in the strike). There was a slightly different negotiating strategy that could have got them everything they wanted in practice if not on paper, and arrangements with other unions (like they had with the steelworkers at one point) could have taken some other industries out of the fight peacefully. But those possibilities were thrown away for a showdown that tried to recreate the overwhelming victory at Saltley that had won them the 1972 strike, but at Orgreave in 1984 it just handed every advantage to the police.

Anybody reading my comment just now addressed to Darkest Yorkshire –
I described therein a long-ago occasion when an aspect of myself ‘dissolved into fragments of light at the periphery’.  I might have got away with this, but who now can tell? l do not recommend anybody trying this ‘route’, however, unless they are within a wholly trustworthy and transparent environment. And there are not too many of those.
On the other hand, the gift of stopping smoking and/or not watching TV perhaps, despite a few downsides, can be accepted with gratitude if it comes. Smile.

On the subject of creatures like the Wendigo, here is a story I used to tell many years ago, but never published anywhere.  It may hint at a strategy to defeat him.
Ssts-Ssts
Every people and every land knows the tale of Ssts-Ssts, but rarely is it told in words.  Rarely, too, do the old tell it to the young, for it is too hard a tale for most men and women to tell once they have met Ssts-Ssts and survived.  As for those who have met him and lost their souls, the dead — even the living dead — tell no tales at all.
Ssts-Ssts is the most beautiful creatures in the world, but also the most terrible.  In outer form he resembles a great serpent: his body is long, lank and legless, and he slithers as he goes.  But Ssts-Ssts has no tail; instead, he has two hideous heads, one at each end of his body.  Ssts-Ssts is always fiercely hungry, but the only food that can satisfy his hunger — even for a brief moment — is a human soul.  He goes up and down upon the world seeking men and women, to feed his hunger with their souls.  If he meets you, he will try to eat your soul; and if he eats your soul, ever after you will go through the bare motions of life as one of the living dead, a man or woman without a soul.
Ssts-Ssts was created to embody in his very flesh everything that men and women find most hard to take.  He is perfectly repulsive, hideous, nauseating, terrifying, loathsome — and every other such word that describes him as well as these do.  Whenever you meet him, your stomach turns and your gorge rises; your muscles turn to water and your bowels loosen; your tongue cleaves to the roof of your mouth and you cannot even scream; words fail you altogether — and your mind flees away into the innermost darkness, gibbering madly as it goes, so as to hide from the horror that is Ssts-Ssts.
If you spend all your days and nights in the company of your fellow men and women, you may never meet Ssts-Ssts.  He does not like brightly lit feasts, where men and women eat and drink and laugh together.  He does not go where two people lie together, their souls as entangled as their bodies, each completing the other.  He does not hunt young children who are wholly absorbed in their games, nor young women talking over their lives as they draw water from the same well, nor young men as they test their strength and courage against one another.
Rather, you are more likely to meet him when you are alone or lost or lonely.  It may be that you have strayed into a deep dark forest, far from the paths of people.  It may be that you have sailed alone to a far-off beach cut off from the mainland by high cliffs.  It may be that all your kin have been taken from you, or have abandoned you.  It may be ….. any such occasion of solitude, even if it occurs in the middle of a crowd of people.  Then suddenly Ssts-Ssts may present himself: you see his form advancing upon you, you hear how it slithers as it draws ever nearer, you smell and taste  his presence, and your sense the feel and texture of his coils before he ever draws near enough to throw them around you.  And your mind flees gibbering away, unable to face Ssts-Ssts.
At that time it will not matter how you may have prepared yourself to meet Ssts-Ssts, whether you have cultivated determination or courage, swiftness or strength, love or compassion, wisdom or purity, or any other such ability or characteristic of a perfect human being.  However brave and ferocious you may be, your will and your courage will fail you.  However swift or strong you may be, your muscles will turn to water and you will be unable either to flee or to fight.  However loving or compassionate you may be, Ssts-Ssts will be beyond your love and compassion, for he has been created by the High Powers that shape our world precisely to be beyond anyone’s love and compassion.  However wise you may have become, your mind will cease to function and your wisdom will desert you.   However pure you may have become, your bowels will loosen and overflow, and wash away your purity in a flood of your own filth.
There are only three courses of action that are open to you when you meet Ssts-Ssts.  Two of them are almost the same, and will not help at all; only the third course of action will save you from his hunger.  
Nor can you choose which of the three you will follow, if ever you happen meet Ssts-Ssts.  Rather, the choice will be made for you, wholly apart from your fears and desires.  The choice may lie deep in your flesh and blood, your bones and sinews, in the body that has shaped you into the person that you are.  Or, perhaps, which course you take may be a mere accident, nothing more than a matter of chance.  Or again, it may be that some Power will guide your choice at that moment, for your weal or woe.  One thing alone is certain: you cannot prepare for Ssts-Ssts before the moment.
When Ssts-Ssts has hunted you down, when you meet him on your way, there are only three things you might do.  Two of them are almost the same, and will not help at all.
You might run away, fleeing as far and as fast a leaf that is blown before the storm.  For Ssts-Ssts this is no challenge at all!  However fast you flee, Ssts-Ssts can go much faster.  He will slither after you, one horrible head facing forward, the other backward.  When he had caught up to you, he will stretch out one of his long necks, open his great jaws, and snap! he will pierce your soul with his teeth, tear it from your fleeing body, and devour it at a single gulp.  Then he will leave you alive, having taken from you the only thing of value that you ever had.  Ever after, for all your remaining days, you will go about the world as one of the living dead, a man or woman without a soul.
Or you might cower, curling up like a new-born baby on the ground, whimpering with dread and despair.  This, too, is no challenge at all for Ssts-Ssts!  He will slither up to you, reach out with one of his horrible heads, open his great jaws, and snap! he will pierce your soul with his teeth, tear it from your huddled body, and devour it at a single gulp.  Then he will leave you alive, having taken from you the only thing of value that you ever had.  Ever after, for all your remaining days, you will go about the world as one of the living dead, a man or woman without a soul.
But the third choice is the only right one, though you cannot make it for yourself, or even prepare yourself for it.  Whether by luck, or because of the kind of person that you are, or because some Power has made the choice for you, you stand fast and watch your doom as it approaches you.  If you do this, Ssts-Ssts hesitates; it is so rare that his prey ever looks at him while he approaches.  He becomes cautious.  He slithers toward you sideways.  When he is near enough, he curves his two necks around so that he can reach you with both his heads at once: one head draws near at your right side, the other at your left.  Now if there is anything more horrible in all the world than looking Ssts-Ssts directly in one of his faces, it is looking Ssts-Ssts directly in both of his faces at once.  And if there is anything more horrible in all the world than having him seize your soul in one set of his great jaws, then rip it from your body, it is having him seize your soul in both sets of great jaws at once, then tear it apart while it is still within you, and rip its sundered halves from your body.  
Even so, you stand fast and watch your doom approach you.  You can do nothing else, because your will and courage have failed you, your muscles have turned to water, your mind has fled away gibbering, all your love and wisdom and compassion have deserted you, and your bowels opened and buried all your purity beneath a stinking mess.  Since you can do nothing else, you stand fast and watch.  Ssts-Ssts draws near to you and reaches out with both his horrible heads at once, the one at your right hand, the other at your left.  Both heads draw near, both great jaws start to gape open — and then, just as he is about to seize your soul and tear it asunder, Ssts-Ssts is finally able to look himself directly in the face, to gaze into his own eyes.   Ssts-Ssts had forgotten how perfectly he had been created, but now at long last he sees himself as he truly is — a perfection of beauty and a perfection of terror —, so that his great hunger abates for a while.  No longer does he hunger to devour the souls of men and women, but he turns from you, satisfied at last — for a season only!  Ssts-Ssts withdraws from your presence, blessing you as he goes.  And this blessing is so replete with Ssts-Ssts’s own beauty and terror that you will never be able to tell the tale as it must be told.

Time to try some free verse:
Some more meditations for you to Steele,
If you’ll just lend me your ears,
Imagine you’re by a Lake.
It’s only there because of limits.
If the water could just flow
Wherever it wished,
Soon there’d be nothing left.
In the same way,
A Ray of sunshine,
Is only there
Because clouds block the rest.
Some would say
It’s Trippy to think,
But oh what a boring world,
A world without limits would be!

@Greer  John, thank you for mentioning Dion Fortune’s books are all now available outside copyright.  With that news I searched for, and found, found an on-line, free, downloadable source of – apparently – all Dion Fortune’s books!
https://archive.org/stream/ThroughTheGatesOfDeath/Dion%20Fortune/Cosmic%20Doctrine#page/n0/mode/1up
I was intending to download it to my Kindle.
However, better yet, THERE IS AN OPTION TO HAVE THE TEXT READ ALOUD on-line.  It is this audible option, in particular, I wanted to share with the community.
I am listening to it now and I am finding Cosmic Doctrine much, much easier to digest in this format (actually a dual format as it highlights a sentence or two at a time and reads that aloud, so you can double-check your auditory comprehension with the written text.
Anyway, I was trying to figure out how I could get with the reading program without going into cross-eyed trance and I find this very much preferable to literally reading it (which increasingly turns into skimming).
Thanks again. I am enjoying this now! Again, maybe it is just me – but I find this a lot easier to take in.  So, see: some technology is useful!

Says Tripp,
” Isn’t life the opposite of entropy? That force for order? The rationalists say it isn’t so, but that doesn’t do much to convince me.”
First of all, yes. But that is just the surface of the question. What is behind life? How is it so astonishing? I don’t exactly know what the force for order is, but I call it the Mind of God, or even the Logos, or Word. Kastrup would simply call it consciousness.
For that matter, I have my  own interpretation of the Christian Trinity. God the Father is God the Mother, as there is a serious issue with Christianity having a tripartate God with no acknowledgement of the feminine. God the Father is the best candidate because for heaven’s sake, to give birth and to have the potential to give birth (The Void of pure potential) is feminine. But to have a cosmos and life forms as we do seems to require a tremendous organizational force. Numbers and rules and laws and shapes are everywhere. Polarity, I believe, is mechanical. A word is a label, a limit, a deliniation, a categorization. These things are masculine and the understanding of and useful organization of things is a masculine trait. Since Jesus was a man anyway and he is supposed to represent that Word of God, I find that makes sense. Now the Holy Spirit really has no gender but I do see it as perhaps more masculine. It is the all pervading energy that ties the whole universe together. It is the life force, the reason that the center is everywhere. God the Mother is the unmanifest, the Holy Spirit is the bridge, and the Word is the Mind of God who makes manifestation.
But it’s a bit more than just life. “Life” requires a substructure that is also a product of the force for order. There are many things in place in the world of matter before life makes its debut. It’s the whole shebang.

“Empower its opposite,”
Is that what you tried to do,

To walk away from the beast,
And leave far behind,
The insatiable hunger
Of the Wendigo we fight.

Not attempting poetry, though admiring other people’s–my last attempts were in high school, post-breakup, and obeyed no laws of man, god, or taste. ;P But I do remember arguing theory in a way-too-early English section, where I hadn’t done the reading but came out of my cloud of sleep and hatred when one of the Interchangeable Sophomores protested (I believe) Poe’s rules of poetic construction because poetry should be spontaneous and come from the heaaaart, and I said that was true if you wanted to produce the kind of poetry you write on the back of your social studies book, using hearts over the i’s, and a Discussion Ensued, after which the TA asked if anyone but the two of us had read the assignment.
There’s a moral here somewhere.
Pogonip, you mentioned King and the Wendigo, and that got me thinking about how much of Pet Semetary deals with the consequences of ignoring limitations or thinking you’re special enough that they don’t apply. There’s the obvious, of course: POV character has several examples of how bringing things back from the dead is a Bad Idea, and does it anyhow. But there’s also the fact that getting to the creepy Wendigo place is a matter of crossing a clear barrier; the precipitating incident, which involves (IIRC) a driver thinking the speed limit doesn’t apply to him and the kid (who, to be fair, knows no better) leaving the limits of the yard; and even the family tensions, a lot of which involve either the main character or his father-in-law not recognizing interpersonal boundaries.
King is another of those authors where I realize that publicly he has no more occult knowledge than slightly nerdy pop culture would account for, and yet there are moments–like the Dark Tower series, in which six Beams, each divided in two, hold the multiverse together, and Insomnia, in which the universal struggle involves the Purpose and the Random, with hints of a Greater Purpose beyond both–where the correspondence makes me think there’s something going on there.
As a general note: I was meditating on Geburah and limitation in general on Wednesday, and particularly how they interact with Hermes, who’s both one of my patrons and all about boundary-crossing. The thoughts that came to me are a) travel and trade and theft are all possible *because* limitations exist, and b) crossing a boundary, or going beyond a limitation, should be an act of conscious will.

I did a careful re-read of the chapter, particularly the section on the Rays, then looked at the blog post again. I realize that I was mistaken about a continuous figure 8 movement that would produce clockwise and counterclockwise movements. The Rays move in the same direction but have a different directional trajectory, one starting its journey above and the other below the Ring Cosmos. The Rays, as I understand the text, begin and end at, and give rise to, the Central Sun.
I think what confused me about the graphic in the blog post was the impression I got that the Rays simply keep traveling around the disc without stopping / starting at the Central Sun. And with the horizontal depiction in which the rays hug the Ring Cosmos, it’s more difficult to see the movement of pulling apart and coming together of the Rays as they exit and enter, leave and return to the Central Sun. It just looked to me like movement on a race track.
I made a drawing of what I envision a cross section of the disc with a pair of Rays might look like. It’s posted at   https://i.imgur.com/7Ew7TS0.gif    I drew it so that the Rays have more of the figure 8 form and more dynamic tension between the opposing pairs.
And as I have meditated on the movement of the Rays as metaphor the following thoughts occur to me:
– The myth of the hero: the call to adventure, the leaving, the awakening and transformation (or death and rebirth), the return home
– The eternal return
– Birth to Life to Death, returning to the origin
– The push – pull ( push me / pull you, pull me / push you ) of relationships of all kinds, the tension created by pulling apart and the explosive energy created by coming back together, like when some people have the best sex after a big fight. (Yeah, I had a relationship like that a long time ago, didn’t last long, but it’s a powerful dynamic.)
– The waxing and waning of the moon phases, the ebb and flow of the ocean tides
The Rays fascinate me for some reason. Maybe because as DF says, they are the first purely Cosmic movement, i.e., movement that occurs strictly within the Cosmos. The movement they make seems so primordial, so fundamental, so (dare I say it?) archetypal to me.
Thanks,
Yanocoches

As I was on my walk this morning, I visualized the rays and the concentric circles, working it around in my brain. The best image I came up with was the idea of a chocolate swirl cheesecake, where the surface of the cheesecake is the plane. Some immortal hand with a cosmic squirt bottle of melted chocolate lays out 7 rings coming out from the center of the batter, then takes a toothpick, and draws 12 rays coming out from the center to the ring cosmos. As the toothpick crosses each ring, the chocolate swirls and eddies with the cheesecake batter, forming prime atoms of deliciousness. Motion: the chocolate being poured and dragged. Vision: the contrast of light and dark locked in opposition. Sound: nom nom nom…

While out doing yard work again, a few thoughts I felt worth sharing..
I’ve noticed that with each chapter the work and images gets move involved yet it all builds on what we learned previously.  It’s a great reminder for us that in the world we live in, you will never find something that goes from not being there to being well developed instantly. Things, whatever they are, do take time to develop and have a process to go through.  The twelve rays and cosmic planes don’t just develop.  It takes the ring-cosmos forming which then develops the ring-chaos and ring-pass-not to balance things.  As it further develops to continue being balanced, then things become more complex.
 We have a great example of this sort of development.  It is the world around us.  An ecosystem over the course of a season may make it a bit clearer.  After the winter, the new sprouts come up, the new leaves form on the trees.  As the season progresses, opportunities for more plants to sprout and/or grow are allowed.  Some plants overtake others in the course of a few days or weeks or months.  It is rare that there is any one dominant species and if there is, overtime something will cause it to weaken allowing another species the opportunity to flourish.  The seasons come and go, the cycles continue.  There is always something growing stronger, something grower weaker, and something coming to replace.  As a system grows more complex, things develop on that complexity.  This does allow more opportunities for the ring-chaos to weaken the system but it also in turn always more opportunities to put a hold on or find a thrusting point from the ring-chaos.

When I was reading Fortune’s description of the rays and concentric circles, I misunderstood and visualized the rays as figure 8s entirely on one surface of the disk, with the center as the crossing point. I then visualized concentric circles essentially all over: within the round halves of the 8s, and any available space between them–spinning off from the rays’ currents like eddies in water. (Wrong though it may be, the image in my mind is really beautiful.) Based on this (mis)understanding it then seemed to me that the Metatron cube was a representation of rays, circles, and angles. Now I see that I got the wrong end of the stick, yet I’m still left with an intuition that the Metatron cube is somehow a representation of what we’re talking about (i.e., the cosmos). I could be wrong though…wouldn’t be the first time. Maybe it will become clearer as we go. 
The thing that really jumps out at me from this chapter is the fractal-ness of the cosmos. I’ve been having a lot of synchronicities since we started reading CosDoc, most of them revolving around synchronicity itself, magic, and Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic resonance. All of these center on some principle(s) of resonance which clearly reflects/is the fractal-ness of the CosDoc.
Re: limitation being necessary for creation, and limitlessness as chaos/diffusion: I will spare you my attempts at haiku or sonnets, but have greatly enjoyed those that have been shared so far. Anyway, this shed a lot of new light on Hexagrams 59 and 60 of the Yijing (I Ching). 59 can be confusing in application because it’s seldom clear whether the dissolution it speaks of is good or bad, in human terms…but of course that depends what you’re asking about, and whether it’s summer/the full moon, or winter/the waning crescent. And 60 is often frustrating to receive, but now that I grok it on a deeper level, will be less so. 
Finally, for those expressing interest in how to deal with what I have heard referred to as the windigo/wetiko “mind virus,” I recommend the chapters “Windigo Footprints” and “Defeating Windigo” from Robin Wall-Kimmerer’s lovely book _Braiding Sweetgrass_. The perspective she gives is, as I recall it anyway, very resonant with JMG’s advice.

Re: Dion Fortune copyrights
As far as I can tell, Dion Fortune’s works are NOT in the public domain at this time. Archive.org seems to be treating them as if they’re a lending library: most of them have a note that you need to join a waiting list for them. That wouldn’t be the case if they were in the public domain.
The best (or at least most comprehensible) page I’ve found on US copyright is at: https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain
That seems to say it depends on whether the copyright was renewed. If it was, they’re still under copyright unless they were published before 1923. If not, they’re in the public domain. I have no personal knowledge if the copyrights were renewed, but I presume Archive.org does, in fact, know.

This sentence…
“The Ring-Chaos can never build anything, because whatever forces it may originate diffuse, unconfined into outer space, but the Ring-Cosmos, in conjunction with the Ring-Pass-Not conserves its forces.”
…brought to mind a cauldron, which, by its restricting nature, allows something within to be created – more so than would simply throwing one’s “ingredients” simultaneously into the air. The same can be said for the creation of ritual space (I’m thinking here of more solitary types) to contain and thereby amplify (and allow for the generation of) something. I’ll not speculate on the nature of the something because my childhood churchgoing experiences fell firmly on the flat side of the spectrum previously mentioned. Kinda like sparkling water bereft if its  carbonation enhancing bottle-top with all the qi dissipated.
…
JMG, unlike gnat who likes audio, I find I meditate best (is that what I’m doing? Certainly not following the rules if so) with the text on paper and a pencil in hand. Many years of practice (and profession as an editor) make this easier than “sitting and thinking.” Should this practice of thinking through writing (including without a separate text but writing as a way to plumb my own mind) NOT be considered the kind of discursive meditation you’re encouraging us to do here? And if so, retraining is indicated?

Hi Isabelcooper!
I haven’t seen the movie, but in the Pet Sematary novel there are hints that the Wendigo isn’t the only bad guy.  In a persistent undercurrent, Louis Creed fantasizes about ditching the wife, kids, and cat whenever they become troublesome, and we readers get the impression his in-laws may have picked up on this and that’s why they aren’t crazy about him.  So I suppose the Wendigo could argue that it was merely giving him what he really wanted.  We in turn might point out that he didn’t want to unload the family in such a tragic way, but then subtlety and tact have never been recorded as Wendigo traits.
The running (sorry) theme of the story is people fleeing when they should stand and fight.  Jud’s running from his guilty conscience about getting Louis involved with the Pet Sematary ,and about his earlier adultery.  Rachel and her parents are running from the guilt and horror of Zelda’s death.  Louis is running from himself.  This theme carries all the way through to the end of the book, when local skeptic Steve Masterton gets a chance to learn about “stuff they never told you about back in the Atheist Society in Saint Louis.”  Me, if I got an offer like that, I’d carry every gun I had and lots of ammo, invoke Saints Michael and Joan, and go forth to learn about evil and maybe even kill off some of it.  (I don’t know when Wendigo season is in Maine but I figure the game wardens are probably pretty lenient with archangels and their hunting companions.).  I bet our host and most readers would do pretty much the same, invoking the Celtic or Druid gods of righteous battle.  Pretty much every religion has such a figure, and the opportunity to get some cosmic questions answered once and for all would be hard for most of us to resist.  But Steve Masterton, in Pet Sematary, runs.
Now, if Pet Sematary is starting to remind you of an entity that consumes and consumes and consumes, and of the people who flee from the problem, who would rather run, and even die, than address it—well, me too.

Tripp, fascinating. I’ve never seen them, so didn’t think of that. As for opening up gaps around the Wendigo, exactly — and of course people can’t discipline their children if they haven’t first learned to discipline themselves. Fortunately that venerable institution, the School of Hard Knocks, provides remedial education programs…
Pogonip, good. Again, you don’t oppose it, you do the opposite instead. Prayer and fasting — turning your attention away from your own ego toward something bigger and more important than you are, and deliberately taking less than you want — would certainly do that. 
Phutatorius, hmm! I’m not familiar with Brown. Thanks for the pointer.
Onething, the rays return to the central sun, but they stay on the same face of the disk as they do so. They don’t go from one face of the disk to the other when passing through the central sun. My diagram in the post may help…
Rita, okay, that doesn’t surprise me. Hemingway’s certainly entitled to his opinion. As for formal poetry, much agreed; I enjoy writing sonnets and villanelles far more than free verse, since the forms force me to explore new word choices and ways of expressing a thought. 
Stefania, excellent! Yes, exactly. It’s the same insight you find in the I Ching: when Yang reaches its maximum it transforms into Yin, and when Yin reaches its maximum it transforms into Yang. 
Berserker, spot on target. In fact, we’ll be discussing precession in a later chapter, in exactly these terms. 
Chris, and I’m rather a Faulkner fan; I just disagree with a notion of American literature that leaves out a couple of generations of good writers. 
Yorkshire, those are excellent examples. Thank you. 
Robert, thank you for this. The equivalent creature in the Puget Sound country is called aya’hos. The intrepid Gordon Cooper (now Grand Archdruid of AODA) and I once went searching south of the Fauntleroy ferry terminal in West Seattle for the stone where, in earlier times, young men would go at night to face the aya’hos; it was a somewhat rougher customer than the ssts-ssts, for if you ran from it, it would twist your head around and your corpse would be found sprawled on the beach the next morning. If you held your ground until its heads saw each other, though, it would become your tamanous, your guardian spirit, and it was one of the mightiest of the klale tamanaous, the “black” or warrior spirits. 
We didn’t meet the aya’hos. On the other hand, when Gordon tried to take a picture of the stone, a camera that had been working perfectly up to that point let out a truly ghastly grinding noise. The repairman said he’d never seen a film drive mechanism convert itself into scrap metal so completely….
Gnat, glad to hear that works for you. Me, I prefer a physical book in my grubby paws, but de gustibus non disputandum est and all that. 
Onething, or in Jung’s terms, that’s the archetype that seized them. A case could be made…
Jaymoses, it’s always seemed to me that this was an attempt by a particular generation of authors to rewrite the history of American literature in the image of their own preferences. I certainly don’t deny Twain’s stature as a major American author, though a very uneven one — I don’t know anyone who bothers to read The Gilded Age any more, except for academics — but he and the specific kind of fiction that follows from his better work aren’t the only current in American literature by a long shot. Nor is Twain as sui generis as his fans tend to think — Twain himself was building on foundations laid by Irving and others, including — despite Twain’s own brilliantly funny denunciations of the man — James Fenimore Cooper. 
Isabel, too funny. Do you think they keep those Interchangeable Sophomores in a warehouse somewhere, and dole them out to classes a few at a time? 😉

How often, in a poem (or song lyric) do you get the sense that the author had to twist the phrase to make it fit?  That might seem like less “honest” expression, but then again, it might give the author license to use language which is so honest that he/she needs an alibi… which would not be available if there were not limits imposed by the form which had to be satisfied.  Or, to express emotions that would be too intense to speak directly.  (These samples will be familiar to many of us, I suspect.)

“And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight”

Thanks, JMG, for providing such a rich commentary on CosDoc! In particular, Fortune’s descriptions of the Tangentials was so cursory that I found it really difficult to understand them based on what was in the text. Good to know, too, about the Days and Nights of Manifestation: I am fascinated by how at one moment CosDoc is referring to the Kabala and the next moment to some key points in Hindu cosmology and concepts of time!
An aside: I just so happened to be reading Hall’s “The Secret Teachings of All Ages” yesterday and near the end of the chapter “Qabbalistic Keys to the Creation of Man” (p.352 in the edition I am reading, to be exact) I came across the phrase “Ring Pass -Not”! The context is the banished Adam not being allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum due to a cherub swinging a flashing sword in a circle. Now, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages” was published in 1928 and I believe that CosDoc was accessible only to Fortune’s inner circle of students between 1924 and 1949. Would I be right in assuming that Manly P. Hall was “well connected” to Dion Fortune in the 1920s? If not, it seems to be a hell of a coincidence!

Hi John Michael,
The intellectual side of ‘Culture wars’ is your natural sparring ground, so mate I concede to your greater prowess, and gently point you in the direction of the nearest bar so that we can enjoy a dark ale and a yak! 🙂 My previous comment can be interpreted, as me politely suggesting that I have no dog in that fight, and if anything I was guilty of repeating what Faulkner wrote. I was not claiming the cloak of expertise, but merely responding to the question that you asked: “Who calls Twain the father of American literature?” Otherwise I would have politely dropped the whole discussion. Anyway, he clearly made that claim for his own purposes, and you know, cultural cringe is a real thing which is often used to berate local efforts whilst elevating lesser folk. It is a bit like stealing manna from others and I don’t have much time for such rubbish. In conclusion, I believe the whole messy and pointless discussion can be summed up neatly as thus: He started it! 🙂
What fun we have here in this polite little corner of this dreadful interweb thing.
Spring has sprung here (despite the snowfall yesterday) and weird things are happening to the plants due to prolonged autumn of several months ago. I suspect that eventually the plants will adapt, but this global weirding thing is going throw us humans some seriously weird curve balls (that is a baseball analogy and hopefully I’ve used it correctly) that are going to cause a few hunger pains and headaches. It is a shame that not enough folks are interested in plants.
Cheers

Hi John,
For a long campaign against the Wendigo, starving it out is the way to go, but if you’re just impulsively deciding to go into the woods, arming up with St, Michael would be the way to go.
And don’t move to Maine.  Place ain’t been right since Stephen King learned how to type.  😁

John,
And to think a week ago I just half skipped over the Pythagorean Mathematics chapter in Manly P Hall’s ‘The Secret Teachings of all ages’ as it was a little too over my head and I just didn’t ‘get it’.
I’ll have to go back and actually try to get my head around that chapter to see if it relates here.
I suspect that’ll help me with understanding Tangentials/vortices/atoms.
There’s allot going on in this chapter.  I’ll work to get my head around this over the next month as much as possible.  But I’d still like to know will the intensity keep ratcheting up each month like this? or will further chapters spend some time unpacking all that’s introduced in this chapter.
I’ve seen these numbers 3/4/7/12 numerous times in different contexts and never felt fully comfortable understanding them.  I feel this is not something that can be taught at one sitting, it’s best reading/thinking/meditating in different contexts and will eventually assimilate into our consciousness.

@JMG: I have my suspicions! I had this theory that they grew them from last years’ batch, like potatoes, but that’s sort of unfair to the noble potato. Either that or they just re-use the last lot: a dye job, a quick fashion update, and they’re back in service.
@Pogonip: Ooh, good points! I also have read the book but not seen the film.
It says something about me, likely, that I’d taken Lewis’s attitude toward his family as the sort of thing that even the most otherwise-devoted spouse and parent has moments of at times. I’ve described my attitude to kids, pets, and men as being basically the same–very cute, fun to play with, but I prefer them to be someone else’s problem at the end of the day. And my parents, now that I’m old enough to hear these things without being Scarred for Life, have mentioned moments when Emi and I were young and extraordinarily bratty and they’d have liked to leave us for the coyotes. So I’d sort of overlooked the fantasies you mention*, but that’s an excellent point.
And I think you’re entirely right, both about the theme–the use of the Wendigo ground is also a form of running, of course, from the inevitability of death and the irreversibility of even “bad” deaths–and about the Steve Masterson angle. I’ve always found that a frustrating trait in protagonists: if *I* got to fight the Wendigo or slay vampires or transform into a magical girl and battle the forces of the Negaverse, I would be all over that action, and the “but I can’t believe this and I just want to be normal” folks are baffling, and make me want to slap them upside the head. 
* Or I’d taken them as part of the general bleakness of the book in general. King’s view of human nature is at its lowest ebb in this and Cujo, IMO, and I’m not sure whether that was down to the late seventies/early eighties, or cocaine, or what.

The Anarchists’ in Covington are channeling you again. Looking for the source to a couple of drawings https://blog.lostartpress.com/2018/08/20/name-the-image-source-a-call-for-help/. Turns out they are from ” Power of Limits” by Gyorgy Doczi. Part of one of the images they were looking for looks a lot like I would envision a ray looking later in time. No mention of DF, CD or you 🙂 Having just read Jung’s Synchronicity – maybe a little….

My sentences du jour say that the Ring Cosmos is concerned with the future, and the Ring Chaos is concerned with the past.  So that would mean that the Ring Pass Not is concerned with the present?  Also seems to imply that one set of rays flows with the timeline (ie., from the centre to the edge of the Ring Cosmos) and the rays on the flip side of Ring Cosmos flow against the timeline (towards the centre).
If I have read this correctly, Fortune is saying that time is more like a radiant emanation, rotating outward from a central point, than a one-way single line, and that there is two-way traffic between the time source (a non-rotating ‘singularity?’) and wherever we are on the Ring Cosmos Disk.
Or maybe I am making a mountain out of a molehill…

I tried to post this earlier and lost it to a weak cell signal, so if it comes through twice, just delete one of them please?
Anyway, this idea of industrial culture and its accelerating destruction playing the part of the Wendigo is doing good things for me.  Today, every time I thought about grabbing my Android I would stop and mentally associate that action with opening up a portal through which the Wendigo could penetrate my inner space (and family), get a foothold and create desire, and almost every time I passed on the idea and went and did something else.
Ecosophia is about the only thing I look at on the internet, for heaven’s sake, but sometimes checking up on it leads me down other rabbit holes, and some of those rabbit holes I could probably do without.  Very little of any of that occurred today, and instead I ended up finishing a new much-improved product label, getting it to the printing company, getting a new business contract out of the result, plus a couple of very promising new leads!  
(And hey, I’m still caught up on my Ecosophia.  Just doing it at the library where the network connection is strong, and I know I won’t waste the time I lost on the first attempt at this post.  Win-win-win.)
Which is all to say, I really love this new mental imagery, and find it extremely practical on the ground.  Lots of own-goals averted already!

Your comment about the flow and use of the life force in a church service/mass in the main post and further comments about the same to Tripp et al, is most enlightening. However, it has made me ponder situations where the life force of a congregation of people is deliberately stirred in a non-religious setting (for example, a rock concert, or a speech by a politician or “motivational speaker”). Where does it go? How does the object of the congregation’s attention deal with this life force if he/she is not a trained mage? Undoubtedly many of them are able to “feed off” this energy, whether consciously or unconsciously. Sex and drugs/alcohol are common outlets for these celebrities/public figures, but some of them seem to go through life unscathed by these outlets of the life force. I suppose these questions come my mind because as a very introverted person, I feel “drained” on the rare occasions that I am involved in such situations (and therefore avoid them like the plague), but when I attend traditional religious rituals or visit ancient places of pilgrimage I feel “charged”.

Not really intended for posting.
@JMG
“Jim, you’re almost there. What do you do instead of opposing something? Empower its opposite. Don’t fight the Wendigo, figure out which forces move in the other direction, and strengthen those, starting with yourself and working out from there.”
So very different from what works for me. 
Empowering the opposite would create a ridge (or problem – same thing) which would become more and more solid and be a growing problem.
For me it is observing and/or communicating into understanding that reduces the ridge which can start at a mere disagreement that grows and grows.
“What you resist persists.”

Doing the reading and pondering the limitations of metaphors to describe what we experience or maybe better said, the composition of the world. Our language describes things as they exist in reality – reality is that which can be described in distance, time, and form – and our brain spends it time in non-reality. Well maybe not your brain, but my brain is certainly in non-reality much of the time! Non-reality for me is fantasies of the future, imagined outcomes of conversations or someone’s response, trying to figure out what someone is thinking, worrying about people, and  rationalizing the past or hyper-fixating on it. Non-reality isn’t “bad”, it’s just not a place to make decisions from because its not real, its just stuff my brain is doing.
What Dion is describing is another reality as she saw it, and its a struggle to understand it. I don’t expect to be walk up and see a cosmic ray, and find it using google maps, but at the same time there is another layer between reality and the non-reality of my brain that is out there. I’m going to keep reading and pondering it and I suspect it just click into place at some point!

One other thing I wanted to add to my last comment was the cosmic timing on the activity in question.  I noticed on the way home from town last night that the moon was in the second quarter of its cycle (waxing gibbous), so it was the perfect time for strengthening and consolidating existing positions.  In this case, it was turning an already good product into a better one.  Curiously, I had some trouble last week getting the print shop work done (the owner was having family issues and her assistant wasn’t doing any printing in her absence) during the “beginning anything new” quarter of the moon…
Another interesting bit of timing, last week I finally got my dear old Camry, Carla, towed to the scrap yard – she had been rotting in the woods for the last 2 years – only to find out that the price of scrap steel had just dropped from $7/cwt the previous week to $5/cwt at that time.  Had I timed that action better, and towed her in during the “ending and letting go” quarter of the moon my $150 check from the recycling center would have been $210.
Hmmm.  Synchronicity?  This kind of stuff is definitely interesting to me, and the applications don’t seem to be purely esoteric in nature!

“The Ring-Chaos must always be thought of as having its affinity with the outer space of the Unmanifest, and a tendency to return to unmanifestation. It looks towards the past and ever seeks the conditions of the past.”
This reminded me of traditionalists.
“The Ring-Cosmos endeavours to focus, as the Ring-Chaos endeavours to diffuse. The tendency of the Ring-Cosmos is towards the future.”
This reminded me of the so-called progressives.
” … the forces which the Ring-Cosmos radiates into that space within its circumference cannot pass out again because they are confined by the influences of the Ring-Pass-Not. Therefore, they act and interact among themselves, producing ever greater and greater elaborations of influences.”
This reminded me of the so-called echo chamber.

@ Tripp.
I was just giving you a tease. Your haiku (the earlier one) was the most sensible comment to be directed at me in the last month. But if serious Haiku wars were to break out, one must be prepared for battle.
@ all
Have I got the image right that the out going Rays are the ones attracted to the Ring Chaos, and indeed they correspond to birth and the manifestation of something closer to the Logos into the rings they reach out to?
Also, are they attracted to the Ring Chaos because in order for the cosmic to become particular and mortal it needs limitation, which is in turn based upon a static opposition of Cosmic and Primeevil force?
Is the shedding of limitation akin to death and with out limitation the forces bound up in opposition separate with negative evil floating out and the cosmic force opposing it dying to the world and nuzzling back into more central spiritual realms, so that death is a ending of the dynamic opposition which sets the limitations inhabited by life force, and when that marriage of Cosmic and Chaotic energy reaches divorce the temporal and contingent realities built upon that stop block diffuse?
Furthermore the cycle of turning to line up with the cosmic or chaotic planes corresponds to times of preponderant creativity and divergence exploration climaxing as the ring approaches the ring chaos; in turn the phase of repulsion from the ring chaos corresponds with a preponderance of selection and informing pruning and pulling inward. Evolution depending on the remnant of one Ur-day acting as a seed crystal to the following dawn; from which branches out a cacophony of derivative forms to select out in the next cycle?
Finally, at the extreme, where the Rays turn inward around the edge of the Cosmic Disc, how is it that they reflect off of the Ringpassnot, and are they at that point still Rays of the Logos, or have they become reflections of the chaos that can never be seen, except via the consequences which manifest among the created, as the Gorgon can only be witnessed through the reflection in the shield?

Hi Isabelcooper,
King has said he was so high he doesn’t even remember writing Cujo.  When he finally sobered up he read it and thought, “This is good!  I liked it!”  I myself would have preferred more of the dog’s point of view and less that of the pre-car-breakdown Donna, who was a very unpleasant person.
Newer editions of Pet Sematary have a foreword where King explains that his then-toddler son ran onto a busy road.  King just managed to catch him, and, of course, thought what-if…

Just a reply to a comment made many comments ago. In physics light is always generated by motion or requires motion. When you pass (move) electrons through a wire filament the heat (atoms oscillating/moving) generates light (this is the principle of the Edison light bulb). Rapidly accelerating charged particles produces electromagnetic waves (i.e. light) which is what happens every time you turn on a radio transmitter. In a laser, light is made to rapidly move back and forth between two mirrors all the while generating more light via stimulated emission. In fact light is comprised of photons, which are perpetually in motion until they are absorbed causing electrons to move to higher atomic and molecular energy levels until they drop back down generating more light. I can give many more examples (lightning aurora etc.) and in all cases motion is involved.

One thing I note with interest is that if you consider the zodiac signs as corresponding with the twelve rays, the linked pairs of opposites are always fire-air and earth-water. In most occult philosophy of which I’m aware, fire and air are considered “masculine” elements while earth and water are “feminine”. In other words, despite the tendency of many occultists to focus on sexual polarity, the polarity discussed here seems to be along different lines. Within the Zodiac, the opposition of elements is based on fluidity/rigidity rather than activity/passivity. “Dry” earth pairs off with “moist” water, while “dry” fire pairs with “moist” air.
My guess would be that the more fluid elements, being more responsive to the pull of the Ring-Chaos, project out from the center along the attracting side of the Ring-Cosmos. Meanwhile their opposite numbers project out along the repulsing side as a counterbalancing act of resistance. Not sure what this would mean in practical terms – something to meditate on tomorrow, perhaps.
JMG, do the rays complete a single rotation from center to the edge and back in the span of one day and night of manifestation?

I have questions about how the Ring Chaos affects the Ring Pass Not and the Ring Cosmos.  Since there is an impenetrable barrier between them, what is the ring chaos effect upon the ring cosmos and visa versa?  I can understand from the text that the Ring Cosmos is related to the diffuse nature of the Ring Pass Not’s near boundary, but the only use I see for the Ring Chaos, is that it was the result prime mover, and what the ring Pass Not and the Ring Chaos use as a push block that started the original and secondary motions, started by the prime mover in the Ring Chaos.  Is that all there is to the Ring Chaos’ effect upon the Rings Cosmos and Pass Not?  That it is also the metaphorical past?

do you are interested in some recent book over “Magic”?
Then maybe you could be interested in this book (if you don’t already have read it)
Real Magic: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Science, and a Guide to the Secret Power of the Universe
by  Ph.d. Radin Dean 
which exposes and summarizes the current “state of the art” of scientific investigation over “magic”
Have  a nice day

JMG,
Say that you have (for example) a moon phase that is auspicious for beginning things, in a season of the year that is suited to ending and letting go–which influence would dominate, or does it depend on various factors? (I have a feeling that your answer is going to be something along the lines of, “Well, that’s what all those maddeningly intricate calculations I mentioned are for…”, but if it’s possible to give a broad overview or general rule of thumb, I’d be interested)
Still enjoying this book club very much, although not able to participate in discussion very often due to technological constraints. Many thanks!

This might be a minor point but my mind keeps sticking on it. I think Harry and Yanocoches have a point about the flow of the Rays.
There is a configuration that is consistent with both the figure 8 and the text that specifies, “…the outgoing flow being above in one half of the circle, and below in the opposite half.”
Draw a figure 8 on its side with force arrows.
Draw a Circle around it.
Bisect the circle with a horizontal line (should pass through the x of the figure 8).
Draw a stick figure standing on the top of the circle.
Draw a stick figure standing on the bottom of the circle.
Now you’ll see a figure 8 with the outgoing flow being above (from one perspective) in one half of the circle, and below (from the opposite perspective) in the opposite half.

Thinking about the Ring Pass Not– It really seems very like the Event Horizon ofa Black Hole.  Once past the event horizon, matter cannot get out again, and nothing outside can see what is happening inside.  Not sure what that might mean for Fortune’s model but it is at least an interesting synchronocity.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Building of the Atom 
September 12, 2018September 12, 2018John Michael Greer95 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 4, “The Building of the Atom,” p. 23-26.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 3, “The Building of the Atom,” pp. 32-35, and the first two pages of the following chapter.
Commentary:
The material in this chapter is easy to misunderstand, so it’s probably wise to revisit two points before going on.  First, it’s essential to keep in mind the basic rule Fortune puts at the beginning of the text—“These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are intended to train the mind, not to inform it.”  Second, this is a textbook of occult philosophy, not of physics. When Fortune discusses atoms in this chapter, she’s using the concept of the atom as a metaphor, not talking about atoms as imagined by the scientists of her time, or for that matter of ours.
Too many students of The Cosmic Doctrine lose track of this basic rule somewhere in these early chapters, and end up trying to force Fortune’s metaphor to fit current scientific notions of atomic structure, or vice versa.  This isn’t helpful at all when you’re trying to make sense of the basic concepts of occult philosophy expressed in terms of visual metaphors—which is after all what we’re doing here.
With this in mind, let’s proceed to the text. The chapter begins with a crisp summary of the nature of Fortune’s (metaphorical) atoms: they consist of two opposing movements locked into a relationship with each other, so that they spin around each other.  I suspect Fortune had the Yin-Yang symbol in mind when she wrote this; whether or not this is true, it makes a fitting visual emblem of the concept in question. While the two movements that form the atom are locked into their relationship, the vortex they form by their spinning isn’t frozen in place; it can move.
Fortune’s metaphor likens this to a waterspout drifting over the sea, but as I write this, another metaphor comes forcefully to mind.  Just as the Cosmos in The Cosmic Doctrine consists solely of movements in space, a hurricane like the one currently bearing down on the US east coast consists solely of movements in warm wet air; a hurricane is a vortex surrounding a Central Stillness; and it moves according to a complex logic of its own, veering this way and that in response to the atmospheric conditions around it. Replace atmospheric conditions with movements in space, and the same is true of the vortices Fortune describes.
Left to themselves, given the principles we’ve already covered, the atoms would probably move in circles, but they’re not left to themselves. They’re formed in the seething cauldron of energies of the Central Sun, in the angles where the Twelve Rays interpenetrate, and so as they’re born they’re jostled and shoved and flung from side to side, and so they end up moving in sudden, jerky, angular patterns. These settle out into geometric patterns—triangles, squares, pentagons, and so on up to decagons (ten-sided figures).
Just as a planet has two motions—it spins around its own axis, and it also revolves around its sun—an atom has two motions:  the two movements that form it spin around each other, and the vortex created by that spin moves through an angular pattern. Once they have settled into a stable pattern, the atoms can then begin to interact with each other. This takes time, but eventually atoms moving in parallel come into interaction and become linked together in a common pattern of movement.  The more atoms gather together in this way, the more of an attraction the resulting mass exerts on other atoms—and the more the mass is affected by the tides of the Cosmos, the great patterns of movement set in motion by the Rings, Rays, and Circles.
Our text finishes sketching this out, and then plunges straight into one of the most important concepts of The Cosmic Doctrine. Back at the beginning of the first chapter, you were asked to imagine empty space flowing, and told that since space is frictionless, once it starts flowing, it keeps flowing forever. Again, this is a metaphor, but it’s one of immense power and importance.
Every movement of space persists forever.  If you move the point of a pen an inch across a sheet of paper, that movement sets space in motion, and the motion never goes away. In the normal way of things, such a motion quickly gets absorbed in some larger pattern of movement, but the Cosmos is never quite the same as it would have been if the movement hadn’t happened. This is true of every action, every word, and every thought.
Each movement lays down what our text elsewhere calls a “track in space.”  When another movement more or less parallel to the first takes place, it will tend to be drawn into that track in space, and to the extent that it follows the track, it reinforces it. As more movements repeat the same motion, following the track left by the original movement, the track becomes more and more strongly fixed, so that any movement that even roughly approximates the original movement will be drawn into the track and follow along the original movement.
We all know this in a personal sense. Repeat the same action over and over again, and it becomes a habit; reinforce the habit often enough, and it becomes fixed. An old but still valid maxim from the New Thought movement phrases it elegantly:  “Sow a thought and reap a deed; sow a deed and reap a habit; sow a habit and reap a character; sow a character and reap a destiny.”
The same rule also applies, however, beyond the personal level. A few years back a scientist named Rupert Sheldrake ran experiments that demonstrated this effect. He showed, for example, that English schoolchildren who didn’t know a word of Japanese were able to learn a Japanese children’s song faster than they learned a sequence of nonsense syllables set to the same tune. Why?  Because generations of Japanese children, learning that song, laid down tracks in space that the English schoolchildren could follow half the world away. Sheldrake’s book A New Science of Life was duly denounced in the scientific literature—the dogma that material effects can only have material causes is deeply entrenched in scientific thought—but nobody ever proved that his experimental evidence was invalid.
To students of occult philosophy, however, Sheldrake’s book came as no surprise, not least because The Cosmic Doctrine discussed the same effect half a century in advance. It’s precisely because repetition has the effects it does that so many occultists perform a single ritual daily, and permit changes in important ceremonies only for very good reasons. Spontaneity has its own gifts to offer, but far more often than we realize, when we think we’re being spontaneous, we’re simply following a set of tracks in space laid down by others in the past.
The implications of this principle reach very far indeed. Several of the implications are discussed in the next few paragraphs of our text. First we learn that as the prime atoms come into being and organize themselves, they are drawn into patterns of movement already set in motion—the great patterns of the Rings, Rays, and Circles that form the Cosmos. Over time, as a result, each of the great composite atoms that emerge from the Central Stillness takes on the form of a miniature Cosmos. Much of the rest of The Cosmic Doctrine focuses on what happens within those smaller Cosmoi, which Fortune and the scientists of her time called Universes, and which we now call solar systems.
The same rule then applies to the things that come into being within those solar systems, including you and me. Everything that exists is conditioned by the larger system in which it exists. In the words of the Emerald Tablet, the great foundational text of ancient alchemy: “That which is above is as that which is below, and that which is below is as that which is above, to perform the miracles of the One Thing.”  That rule applies at all levels. Any pattern of movements that establishes itself as a steady rhythm becomes a foundation on which later realities must build.
The text asks us to imagine a prime atom that moves in a triangular pattern because of the influences acting on it at the time of its formation. As it interacts with other forces, the basic triangular movement becomes modified into a pattern of three interwoven spiraling movements, a little like that shown in the diagram. Behind that complex pattern lies the simple geometry of the equilateral triangle, shown by the dotted lines. Take this metaphor and apply it, and it becomes possible to see how, behind the intricately interwoven spirals of life, a scaffolding of basic patterns can be traced. Understand the patterns and you understand where the spirals are going and why.
Each prime atom, in Fortune’s metaphor, consists of just such a pattern of spirals traced around one of eight possible geometrical figures, from the triangle to the decagon. Each prime atom forms connections with other atoms that have the same geometrical basis—as our text says, “whose angles of stress are similar”—and the composite atoms that result begin to drift outward from the Central Stillness, following the lines of one of the Rays and passing from the center into the first of the Circles. There the composite atoms unite with other composite atoms of the same basic geometry to create even more complex composites, and these then drift out into the Second Circle, where the process repeats with similar results. Eventually the whole Cosmos, right out to the Ring-Pass-Not, is full of atoms, ranging from prime atoms in their pure state in the Central Stillness to unimaginably complex atoms in the Seventh Circle.
It’s when some of these extremely complex atoms take on one more level of complexity that the process of Cosmic evolution proceeds to its next phase.  We’ll discuss that next month.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text. There are a lot of images in this chapter, so take your time and try to imagine each one as clearly as you can.
As you do this, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on October 10. Until then, have at it!

This has finally helped to answer a question I’ve been pondering a lot recently since starting my Customer Service job and noticed during the day there will be a common pattern for the reasons people call during the day.  That pattern may change day to day so that I wonder what sort of calls will be common for the day, but there is always a pattern.  Now I’ve got an answer to why that happens, and it’s one of the occult, not materialistic!  Quite exciting stuff we are covering, thank you JMG, as always!

John–
Re the laying down of tracks and tapping into tracks previously laid down
If a ritual, prayer, practice, et cetera is of analogous form, though not precisely the same, does one tap into that which has been elsewhere established, though perhaps to a lesser degree?  What came to mind as I read that portion of the post was the bit of Latin with which you helped me a few years back — my “Gaia Thea,” as it were — which is so closely modeled on, and structurally similar to, the “Ave Maria.”  Am I, by reciting that prayer regularly as I do, availing myself to some degree to the centuries of previously-established ritual?  (Certainly not an intent of design, but a benefit not to be discarded, if true.)

“He showed, for example, that English schoolchildren who didn’t know a word of Japanese were able to learn a Japanese children’s song faster than they learned a sequence of nonsense syllables set to the same tune. Why?”
Because languages have patterns, songs have rhymes and similar?
You’re not the only writer I follow that’s for morphic resonance, but I don’t see how emergence, efficiency etc don’t suffice. People do the same things in the same situations because those are the easiest / most obvious / best things to do.
From a “train the mind, not inform it” perspective, sure you can call those underlying reasons movement in space. But to me it sounds like saying things fall because things previously have fallen, and not because of gravity.

I remember reading some years ago that Rosicrucians believed that the Roman Catholic Church would lose a great deal of power if it abandoned the Latin Mass because the repetition around the world of identical words built up energy. At the time I had no background to understand the reasoning, but it did make a intuitive sense. I assume that Fortune would have agreed with that idea. Especially when one considers that the mass was not just performed for public worship but also by individual monks and basically would have been being performed somewhere in the world every hour of the day. Which is still true, just not in Latin everywhere. On the other hand, growing up Protestant, I was taught to regard this sort of thing as mindless repetition of prayers and basically superstitious. 
I recently read _Aleister Crowley and Dion Fortune: the Logos of the Aeon and the Shakti of the Age_ by Alan Richardson. It was fairly interesting, although his method of working backwards through the lives of both figures was a little confusing IMO. I hadn’t realized the extent of the contacts between the two, although knowing how small and overlapping the occult world of England was it isn’t really surprising. I wouldn’t recommend this book to the top of a reading list, but it would be of interest to anyone studying this period and the personalities who shaped it.

Would materialists likely consider harmonic resonance to be the modern, scientific equivalent to what Dion Fortune is explaining here?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								September 12, 2018 at 4:50 pm							




Prizm, that’s a good practical example. 
David, yes, that would follow. To extend Fortune’s metaphor a little, the tracks in space provide some momentum to anything moving in something like the same direction, and some drag on anything moving in something like the opposite direction. 
Sofie, good. Have you checked to see whether Sheldrake controlled for those variables? 
Rita, to my mind the Rosicrucians were quite correct, and the dramatic tailspin that’s been suffered by the Roman church since the Latin Mass was abandoned is evidence for this. 
Prizm, I’d encourage you to read Sofie’s comment to see how materialists respond to the concepts we’re discussing!

JMG
Yes, I was thinking of Sheldrake before I reached that paragraph. Smile
It might be relevant – thus when we follow the track to knowledge already ‘out there’ but not yet in our personal universe? 
Conversely, it can be strange to tread new ground. I remember inventing a simple device whose working logic appeared (and still appears) to be genuinely ‘new’. It was a very strange feeling not felt before nor since. The device seemed surprisingly difficult – given its simplicity – for others to understand even with a working example.

I’ve noticed in conversation with many people that they often seek answers in concrete terms.  Few seem to realize that even our verbiage is abstract.  It seems an often mentioned metaphor that some Native American tribes have describing life as a web is a great equivalent metaphor.  Every action in the web can be see across the web in it’s entirety.  It’s a useful way to remind ourselves of how everything is inter-connected and how one movement can be felt far, far away.  In the real world, there are no bounds whether of distance or time, or whatever other abstract unit of measurement a person decides to use to describe the measurement.

Hey all,
Keep coming back to complex adaptive systems theory when I read these posts, and many of your books. Is CAD the modern spin on this?  The context I’ve seen CAD discussed is learning and the non-linear nature of second language learning. You try, get a bit better, you try some more, feel like your getting worse, get better, realise you don’t know what you think you did, try some more  (or don’t and pack it in)etc. Are there infliction points here?  Points in what were discussing? The point at which the simple becomes complex, that grain of sand that causes the pile to fall? Apologies all a bit vauge, just can’t can’t away from CAD.

Dear JMG,
any chemical working  in the development of new crystals or polymers  can attest the existance of that “the track becomes more and more strongly fixed” to be followed by others. When someone sinthezysis a new compound, as soon as the process is established, it often occurs that another lab, half world away will produce the same by accident. I eard the same  occurs in animal behavior…For humans many other coincidences are intriguing as the invention of coins for instance.
In this universe of Ms Fortune the most complex structures are the closer to the ring caos, good thing that the ring pass not is there! The stilness in the centre is it as still as the inmanifested outside the ring caos? It probably doesn’t matter, the universe doesn’t go that far….

@Sofie – “From a ‘train the mind, not inform it’ perspective, sure you can call those underlying reasons movement in space. But to me it sounds like saying things fall because things previously have fallen, and not because of gravity.”
Actually, Sheldrake might actually maintain something like that – at least pertaining to the context we are discussing (since context is everything, in the end). He seems to regularly cite an experiment whereby lab rats had to perform certain actions in order to their get their reward. Over time, as the identical experiment was done at different locations globally, they saw that it became easier for the rats to go through the routine, and more quickly… to me, that sounds more like “fallen” and not merely “gravity”…
@JMG – As for the English schoolchildren who didn’t know Japanese but were able to learn a Japanese children’s song faster than they learned a sequence of nonsense syllables set to the same tune… Sheldrake has previously cited another experiment wherein participants, who didn’t know the Hebrew language or alphabet, were to indicate which Hebrew characters were genuine or fake, as a handful were thrown into the mix which had been “designed” for the test. The resulting high number mostly favored a correct identification. So, in this case, while the genuine Hebrew characters were easier to discern, suggesting the effects of resonance, the non-genuine ones produced no intuitive recognition.
Incidentally, Sheldrake (who self-identifies as being a skeptic) seems usually pretty astute in performing the necessary due dilligence with respect to experiment controls, etc.

“Each movement lays down what our text elsewhere calls a “track in space.”  When another movement more or less parallel to the first takes place, it will tend to be drawn into that track in space, and to the extent that it follows the track, it reinforces it.”
I am way over my head with this stuff, but this calls to mind something you wrote, it may have been “the strange absence of belly bones” or similar.  Once a path is set in motion in evolution, there is no going back, or so it would seem.  Our ancestors developed a back bone, end of story.
If we imagine ET’s examining life here (“higher” life forms, insects and bacteria are much more interesting), they might find Earth hopelessly boring.  “They all are the same, a torso with attachments, one for observation/analysis, with the same equipment, two sensors for electromagnetic radiation, two for vibration in the atmosphere, one for chemicals in same, an opening for taking in O2 and stuff for it to oxidize, lower down for appendages used mostly for locomotion.  Etc., etc.  the place is hardly worth any more attention.”

Phil, I bet! Genuinely new ideas are rare, and they’re also difficult to grasp. 
Prizm, it’s one of the common downsides of the maturation of a civilization that its language becomes increasingly abstract, and thus increasingly detached from the concrete realities of human experience. We start off with the concrete image of a spider’s web, and end up with an abstract concept like interconnection, which has advantages but also loses the grounding in concrete reality that lets us recognize, as the fly discovers the hard way, that too much interconnection is not an advantage…
Kimberly, of course it isn’t. Sofie was using a rhetorical gimmick here to prop up her ad hoc argument. 
Shizen, I’m not at all familiar with complex adaptive systems theory as such — plain old ordinary systems theory was the grounding of my studies in ecology. Be careful, though, that you don’t fall into the trap of thinking that because you’ve got another set of metaphors that you can use to model the phenomenon, that those metaphors are the truth about the phenomenon…
Elodie, that’s fascinating — I didn’t happen to know that. Yes, extreme complexity is closer to chaos than simplicity — I suspect we all know that from personal experience — and the stillness of the central sun is of a very different kind than the stillness of the Unmanifest — think of the difference between a ballet dancer perfectly still on one toe, held in exquisite balance by the perfect control of muscular motion, and the same ballet dancer sound asleep in bed the night after the performance, with every muscle limp. The former’s the central sun, the latter’s the Unmanifest. 
Petrus, oh, I know. I tend to ask that question of people who bring up ad hoc arguments to try to counter Sheldrake’s work, precisely because his experiments are by and large very capably designed, and if they go back and read what he’s written they tend to discover that they’re engaged in handwaving!
Michael, good! Yes, that was “A Peculiar Absence of Bellybones,” which you can reread here. That’s certainly part of it. Don’t worry about being over your head with this material, by the way — it’s very complex, challenging stuff, and it takes a lot of close study to get everything it has to teach. If you keep working at it, though, you’ll learn some useful things.

Again, JMG a fascinating commentary on some really dense concepts!
I wonder again if the tracks laid down by a ritual are not affected by the apparent direction of time.  We could think of a ritual as having a lifetime– Suppose there is a hypothetical god, Ozymandius.  Someone, somewhere did the first ritual honoring Ozymandius (and was blown out of her socks by the positive response).  Then perhaps millenia later, the very last person did the very last ritual to Ozymandius–Perhaps the track that all of these practitioners followed does not get better with our experienced passage of time, but is more like a resonating structure of power affected by all practitioners (apparent past, apparent present, and apparent future) throughout its timeline.  Any thoughts on that?
Oh, and apologies in advance to anyone who may be worshipping Osymandius. 🙂
I experienced something of this while growing up in a Protestant Church while singing the hymns.  The verse, “Time, like a never-ending stream/ Bears all its sons away/ They fly, forgotten as a dream / Does at the break of day” always seemed to put me in the middle of a vast  number of folks, singing those words in a single, transcendent place–as if everyone who ever sang it once, only EVER sang it once, all together, outside of time and space.
That would explain why ‘Gaia Thea’ might be as powerful an experience as ‘Ave Maria.”  Also could explain why AODA practitioners experienced positive results even while believing that the rituals were made up, and quite recently.  What if AODA (or any other group of recent origin) turns out to be just at the beginning of a multi-millennial run, and its members are benefitting from the resonance of rituals far in our apparent future?
Changing subjects, I continue to experience synchronicities between the text and other life experiences–
The building of atoms in Fortune’s model reminds me very much of the fractal patterns that seem to pop up everywhere in nature.  Fractals start large and the patterns repeat in smaller and smaller versions of themselves.  Repetitions of the same grand theme on smaller and smaller scales ad infinitum.  Sound familiar??
I think Benoit Mandelbrot was mathematically working this stuff out in the 1980’s, and to me the parallels are just gob-smacking!
Mandelbrot says that his fractals start as lines with one (1) dimension, but as the iterations continue, the dimensions approach two (2).  A fractal can have, for example, a dimensionality of 1.7, somewhere between a line and a plane.  I’ll be interested to see if that pops out of Fortune’s work as things move along. 🙂

Growing up in the trades many moons ago, the old WWII vets hammered home the habits of doing things right, in the same pattern they were taught. You would embrace it because it was time honored. They embraced it to forget the horrors and move on in a positive and constructive  way.. I walk, bike  or drive about today…those ideals are lost, hence the ugliness and disassociation.







 Phutatorius says: 



								September 12, 2018 at 8:43 pm							




The first question that occurred to me in regard to the “atoms” was what happened to the number two?  We have one, and then three through ten.  The second is in relation to the comment from Sofie regarding gravity; there’s a sort of question begging here; as if we actually understood what gravity is.  Has anyone detected or measured the posited “graviton”?  I remember reading in some popular physics texts speculation that the laws of physics themselves are not constant but subject to an evolution.   
I’ve read a good deal of Sheldrake’s writing.  I seem to recall two names of people who preceded him in his line of thinking: C.S. Peirce and C.H. Waddington (who came up with the notion of chreodes decades earlier.)  
JMG: I find that your commentaries on CosDoc are helpful; I plowed through it on my own with little understanding a couple of years ago, but this is helping.

I want to thank you in general for writing this series, and I want to thank you so much for that diagram of the triangle as three spirals. I found that incredibly helpful. 
I’m still struggling a little with the last paragraph or two… specifically with the equilibrium and what oversets it.
“The oversetting of the balance is due to the same forces as set up the primal Rings” (which was that prime movement coming from the unmanifest?)
 VS
“such an equilibrium being only a maintaining of position of movements relative one to another being therefore a relative stillness, must always overbalance”
(which seems to me to imply that it was not truly an equilibrium, and just an almost equilibrium) 
Also, Since I’m spending so much time on going through this line-by-line, I thought I would start typing up my novice grappling with each part and posting it on my personal blog. Hopefully you don’t mind the outgoing link, if you do, of course, feel free not to approve the comment.

 Radha says: 



								September 12, 2018 at 11:16 pm							




I wrote the below comment last month, but it took me till Monday. So most of my comment is related to the 3rd chapter. Chapter 4 seems very straightforward, so no questions yet. I just got a new 2000 copy, because my 1988 copy fell to pieces. I am excited to see there are drawings at the end. I may rethink the Rays, since I did not imagine the spirals to be so tight, but I’ll leave my original thoughts on the Rays below. Also, since I started reading this book, my life has improved significantly.
I struggled to visualize the 12 Rays:  Because Fortune says the Rays are circular, spiraling, and form figure 8 pairs, I was trying to imagine ways that they would be evenly spaced out to fill all the space within the sphere. I first came up with something like the swirly inside of a marble, with six rays in the upper half and 6 rays in the lower half, all meeting at the center. If I understand your description correctly, they are more like 12 orange slices or a magnetic field.  In your diagram, there is a figure 8, but the ray doesn’t fill up the whole space, it stays near the disc, like bicycle spokes. It’s hard for me to imagine that the rays wouldn’t be filling up the sphere. But perhaps it’s most useful to imagine the disc divided and not worry about what’s happening in the rest of the sphere?
I spent some time wondering why there would be 12 Rays specifically. My first thought is that each of the quadrants is divided by 3, one each for ring-cosmos, ring-chaos, and ring-pass-not. This continues to make sense since those are the 3 fundamental forces that influence everything. Another thought is related to drawing 12 sided stars with a compass, which I used to do. I still don’t understand why there are 7 Circles, perhaps just 4 + 3? I know you said 12 and 7 are to do with the Mystic Qabalah, so I will read that soon.
There’s an interesting similarity of the 12 Rays to acupuncture Channels: there are 12 Channels and 8 Vessels. The 12 Channels are for daily energy flow, like rivers, and the 8 Vessels are reservoirs, supplying the rivers. The 8 Extraordinary Vessels are formed at the meeting of the egg (Yin) and the sperm (Yang). When they meet, the first two Vessels are generated– front and back, the polar axis) The first two cellular divisions create the other 6 Vessels. With the 1st cell division –  left front, left back, right front, & right back are formed. In the 2nd division – the waist & vertical cores are formed. The 8 Vessels follow closely the original formation of the cosmos. The 8 Vessels are formed first and then it divides into 12 channels to grow the body (doubled by mirror image, so 6 for each leg and 6 for each arm). All of them are meeting in the head or torso, forming a circuit. Energy flow completes a circuit through all 12 channels each 24 hour period.
In a Yin-Yang symbol, the ring-pass-not is the ‘S’ line dividing black and white. I do not imagine it having any space, as it is the transition between two opposites. Although Fortune says there is a space there, I don’t think that really matters because it is an impossible place. I see the ring-pass-not as connected to the concept of Metal in Chinese 5 Elements theory. Metal is halfway between solid and liquid. When you melt earth, metal seeps out, and becomes liquid. So Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water. It only makes sense when you think of these substances as phase changes of the same substance. In Chinese medicine the skin, lungs, and intestines are considered Metal tissues. These are the body’s internal/external barriers. You can think of Metal as electrified, it is constantly oscillating between two states. Also it is like plasma. The spark of life. Only when opposing forces are engaged, does life occur. 
The cross or the two rings: I hadn’t thought of the cross as two crossing rings looked upon from above until now. Also if you looked at two orthogonal waves on end, you would also see a cross. I’m starting to understand more about the use of the cross and circle in rituals. 
When the first current begins, the time it travels in a straight line before slowing down is eons long. But since there is no frame of reference, that time could be as short as an inhalation. Then when the line slows down and returns to it’s starting point, that’s the length of an exhale. As each layer of complexity is added, time dilates, because there is a previous point of reference. That’s a way to think of the center expanding. “the whole of evolution turns upon the difference in size between the planes.” 
Ova and Sperm: a point in infinity gains awareness (Yin – a stationary point), then there is an inspiration to move (Yang – motive force), and it becomes a line that moves forward without slowing down (Yin – the line becomes unchanging). It has a second inspiration (Yang) and decides to slow down. The first line circles round as it slows and creates a circle. It’s like a line drawn on a piece of paper and you roll the paper into a tube and the end of the line meets the beginning. 2 dimensions have been invented. Those are the first 2 breaths of the cosmos. 
Now, imagine that ring is an ova. It’s Yin now (an unchanging circle). Third breath – Sperm hits the ova and sets it spinning, like a coin. The spark of life. There’s 3 dimensions now. I hear a bell ringing when it starts.
I was really stuck on understanding why the second ring spins off in a certain direction, the “opposite” direction. Why is the opposite direction at a right angle? That didn’t make sense to me. And why does the second ring happen to be on the same axis as the first ring? 
Here’s my attempt to understand this. Before the first ring started spinning like a coin, it was floating in infinity. There were no outside currents for a point of reference. Currents were going off at right angles in all directions as the circle was formed, but all of them spun off into infinity. Infinity is the place where all things continue to exist forever and all permutations are possible. And yet nothing is possible, because there are no limits. Only one location for the second ring to begin is sustainable. That location is where the original current takes off, the beginning point. There is no axis yet, but the two unequal forces (inhale and exhale) eventually find an equilibrium and form a groove in infinity (they must be extraordinarily stable to do that). If imagining this on a wave graph, there are two waves moving in opposite directions (when one goes up, the other goes down. Ring chaos is a mirror image of the ring cosmos. It’s the shadow side or Yin.) The recurring point where the two waves meet at zero is the place where the second ring takes off. This is when the two waves, originally on the same X-Y axis, separate and form a Z axis. Since they repel each other, one of the waves will rotate to the Z axis in order to be as far away from the other wave as possible. It’s only when the second ring takes off, that the axis is formed. So it starts with orthogonal waves and when you look at them on end, you see a cross. Later, when the cross starts spinning, you see a sphere.

David, that’s true, but not actually the point here. The point I wanted to make is that people these days get so caught up in equating one set of metaphors to another that they end up thinking that one set of metaphors is the reality behind some other set. Consider the way that a lot of people who read Jung — though not, I hasten to say, Jung himself — came to think of Jung’s theory of archetypes as the reality behind the metaphor of gods. Au contraire, gods and archetypes are two different sets of metaphors for a set of concrete human experiences; as Jung himself pointed out, in the end, all of Jungian psychology is just one more myth of individuation…
Emmanuel, excellent! Yes, in fact that seems to be the case to at least some extent. Certainly people nowadays seem to have had no trouble picking up the tracks in space even from very old Pagan traditions, and it wouldn’t surprise me if some of the new but very powerful magical workings I’ve done, or seen done, got their power from people doing them in the future. 
Dennis, true enough. If someone wanted to take up those patterns again, though, the tracks in space are still there…
Phutatorius, in magical philosophy two is always transient. You have the Ring-Cosmos and Ring-Chaos, and then they generate the Ring-Pass-Not. You have two movements coming into interaction, and then they form an atom and stop functioning as two separate things. Glad to hear that these commentaries are useful! 
Pogonip, my experience with Japanese is that the grammar is simple but the vocabulary is very subtle, loaded with connotations, and tricky…
Gawain, good. Yes, “a bundle of tracks in space” is a good working metaphor for an egregor. 
Harry, no objection at all. As for the equilibrium, it’s a true equilibrium, but like everything else in the Cosmos, it rests on the Cosmic framework of Rings, Rays, and Circles, and when the Rings pivot around and their influences change, everything else changes. It’s as though you built a house of cards on a table, got everything stable and balanced, and then tipped the table…

Sofie: “People do the same things in the same situations because those are the easiest / most obvious / best things to do.” 
Who or what makes them easiest to do? As an example, learning a language is obviously a faculty of mind. I doubt that when comparing all the languages spoken around the world, anybody could find a common characteristic of what makes a language or alphabet “easiest / most obvious / best thing to do” – so there seems to be no “natural law” (like gravity) behind this.
Prizm: “Would materialists likely consider harmonic resonance to be the modern, scientific equivalent to what Dion Fortune is explaining here?”
Resonance (if you want to talk materialistic better leave the harmonic out as an adjective in this context or at least be very careful with how you use it) is to my mind very good as an analogy for a lot of things happening within and between us. (thermodynamics too, especially  for large groups of people like a society… 😉 ) However, and unfortunately the true materialist seems somehow to be blocked to this insight, classic science simply do not cover consciousness (and there are a lot of scientific experiments to prove that consciousness does not simply arise from configurations of matter). (it provides us with a intricate language (!) to describe *how* things are – however it does not hand us with a single fundamental *why*)

Re metaphors and traps
Rather like thinking, for example, that one shadow is the form casting another shadow, when both are actually different perspectives cast by an still-unseen actuality?  So, the challenge is, if I’m seeing this correctly, partly one of remaining mindful to keep one’s symbols pointing toward that unknown/unknowable reality and not get caught in a circular reference where the symbols merely point to one another.

I went through an ‘invention’ phase 35 years ago.
Some more academic insights away from my own field did seem to make, as it turned out, anonymous contributions.
Rather naively though I got a simple device patented i.e. spent money.
(Patenting is about making money and I could not back that up. I got some interest but it was the ancillary non-patented stuff that got developed off existing product lines, some of which is still out there I think.)
Anyway, it was control of gravity-fed watering of fairly evenly spread-out plants on benches in medium large greenhouses. No electrics, no pumps – adjusted itself as plants grew. I was rather fond of it. Still have some photos somewhere I guess. Lovely to hear it speed-up when the sun came out and slow down as a cloud went over.

“But to me it sounds like saying things fall because things previously have fallen, and not because of gravity.”
I’d say it is both. The mass of the Earth is such because so much mass already did fall (due to gravity) to create the Earth. Things fall the way they do now (with a specific acceleration rate and terminal velocity) because of all of the previous falling.
The previous falling on the Moon determines the way in which things fall there now.
@JMG
If the spirit of the cosmos were to attempt to describe a celestial dynamo and the process by which complex systems organize themselves in the presence of large energy gradients to a talented medium (or set of mediums), this book is exactly what I would expect the end-result to look like.
I know you caution repeatedly not to look for too much physics but I cannot HELP but find interesting parallels.
For instance the results of the first three activities (Movement, Light, Sound) follow the evolution of the early universe.
The first thing that happened during the big bang was an expansionary phase as the result of the force of Gravity splitting from the wholeness. – Movement.
At this point the universe consisted of only space and plasma and would have emitted a LOT of photons. – Light
The next force to split from the wholeness was the Strong Force and the first act of the Strong Force was to create the first gas AKA medium though which vibrations can travel. – SOUND
Fascinating read. Am enjoying this series quite a bit.

Before we go on, I’ve fielded a small flurry of nearly identical posts by rationalist trolls, all rehashing what’s apparently the current party line over in Debunkerland about why Rupert Sheldrake’s experimental results ought to be ignored. Folks, come on. You can find a detailed discussion of the rhetorical gimmick you’re using here — look for the discussion of “ad hoc hypotheses.” If you want to challenge Sheldrake’s experimental results, saying “well, it might have been factor X” or “it must have been factor Y” emphatically does not cut it; in case you’ve forgotten, that’s exactly the kind of logic that was used by the opponents of Copernicus and Darwin back in the day. If you have a hypothesis, fine — run an experiment to test whether your hypothesis is true or not. Until you do that, you’re just shoveling smoke.

At the risk of oversimplifying, I think the entire scientific materialist worldview in general can be characterized as one grand ad hoc hypothesis.  You can tell that you hit a nerve when scientific materialist choose to focus on one particular example of your overall essay this week, missing the point of why that example was used in the first place, and in the process dismissing your argument out of hand.
For me, the picture of the prime atom immediately brought to mind the triquetra, an incredibly potent personal symbol for me, on par with Mjolnir.  This is where I really find the value in The Cosmic Doctrine on the first read through; exploring the symbolic meanings and implications of the things Dione Fortune is trying to discuss, how they stand on their own, how they relate and compare to other ways you already interpret the world, and how those interact together to form new ways of thinking.  No doubt every read through of the work will open up new paths of thought.

Robert, good. One of the points that Fortune is trying to make here is that natural laws are the habits of the Cosmos — thus finding, or at least seeking, a useful balance between the observed regularities of the Cosmos and the observed emergence, from time to time, of genuine novelty. I’ve thought more than once of building an argument for Burkean conservatism on the basis of The Cosmic Doctrine — political and cultural institutions and customs have their own deeply rutted “tracks in space,” and settle into an equilibrium which from time to time gets disrupted by changes in the wider cosmos. 
Eduard, exactly. That’s why I cited Sheldrake in the post. 
David, exactly — and just as in Plato’s metaphor, all we can see are the shadows. 
Mac, got it in one. That principle runs all through the Cos. Doc. 
Kay, excellent! The entire tradition of sacred geometry rests on that same insight. 
The Universe, by all means find parallels! The difficulties creep in when people try to rearrange the teachings to fit the latest modern physics, and as long as you avoid that, you’re fine.
Dan, modern science certainly rests on a couple of unverified and unverifiable hypotheses — above all else, the insistence that every material event must have a material cause. As for Fortune’s work, though, exactly — every time I go through the Cos. Doc., and I’ve done it more than a dozen times, I find different themes to follow up.

The resonance experiment I’d like to see is one that begins with a population of nonsense rhymes, and splits them into three, randomly selected, groups. The first group is used as a seed for artificial evolution, using methods developed for computer simulations: mutation and cross-pollination with periodic selection of those easiest to memorize. The second would be kept precisely unchanged, but learned by rote with much greater frequency. The final, control, population would remain unchanged, and also would only be memorized as frequently as the evolving population.
Memes adapt to our minds, after all. My guess is that nursery rhymes “from the wild” have a catchiness, viz. the human nervous system, that their long-forgotten competitors lacked, and that the catchiest parts of a rhyme are likely to inspire similar structures as new rhymes are composed.
I admit that my experimental design would cost a lot more than the one mentioned here.

Not a comment on the reading per se., but since the subject of learning languages come up I thought I would mention an article in the Sept. 3 issue of The New Yorker, “The Mystery of People who Speak Dozens of Languages” by Judith Thurman. The author interviews a hyperpolyglot and gives a short history of the phenomenon and what it may mean about the nature of language and the nature of learning languages. In case you wonder, the standard for polyglot is fluency in eleven languages. 
Meanwhile I continue to note the complete absence in the other pages of the magazine of any awareness that Trump is not universally hated and despised. A tightly sealed bubble.

What I find fascinating is that if each of us is a separate ring cosmos with accompanying ring pass not, since nothing can escape the ring pass not, everything we think is occurring outside of ourselves is actually occurring inside ourselves. The concept that each of us creates our own universe whose form is dependent on our consciousness is not new, but the Cosmic Doctrine puts an interesting new meaning to it that I am still working on understanding. Thanks to everyone for your insights.

I’m intrigued by the notion of these tracks or grooves in space and behavior being so impactful across time and societies. What happens when a (portion of) society decides that it no longer wants to abide by those long-standing grooves? Their existence would seem to make societal change extremely hard to enact, especially as it would take time to establish different tracks with the depth of “stickiness” as the old ones. 
I’m thinking here of the difficulty in our society (among many) to establish and maintain roles and norms of behavior between men and women or between white and black people that are truly egalitarian and not based on control or ownership or coercion. 
Is this what Fortune means by having to “hate the hate” more and then use love to make new tracks, and that causes the old tracks to get “poisoned” in some way? 
Are there means of speeding up the creation of new tracks described later in the book – of making them “go viral” ? I suppose this is the true understanding of tipping points in dynamic systems.

Mac, I don’t have an algorithm for deciding how to say “that was a great comment,” so I’m not at all sure how to answer! 
Joel, no doubt, but that would be a fascinating experiment. 
Rita, fascinating. I’ll have to check it out as time permits. 
Dan, good. Are you familiar with the old metaphor of the Net of Indra? The story goes that the god Indra has a net; wherever the threads cross, there’s a pearl; in the surface of every pearl, every other pearl in the net is reflected. This, the story goes on to say, is the universe; all sentient beings are pearls, and each of us reflects, and is reflected by, all the rest of us. 
KF, excellent! Yes, that’s exactly it. If you want to establish a different set of tracks in space, you and others have to repeat the same actions over and over again. That’s why it’s so important to follow Gandhi’s advice to be the change you want to see in the world — you have to enact the change in order to lay down the tracks in space for others to follow.

“Tracks in space”, yes, it’s fascinating how this stuff makes full sense, but sometimes only after someone with the benefit of experience and insight was able to distill it down into a simple message. It also explains the experience my mate had with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, he believed that the summoning version went clockwise, with the nanishing version going anti-clockwise. He described the experience as basically like having a bucket of cold water tipped over his head constantly.

“These then are the primary influences; they may be thought of as the framework of the cosmos.”
“But these new universes, as they are called, while they have the same laws as the Cosmos before described, are also influenced by that framework of the Cosmos which was built before they began, and you will find that this law holds good throughout all manifestation.”
These two statements remind me of a passage from the Tao Te Ching: “Heaven’s net is vast; though its meshes are wide, nothing escapes.”
Meditating on the Rings with the Rays emanating from the center and then cut across by the Circles, I definitely start to get the impression of a net, drawn in lines of force.  This net of forces permeates every aspect of the Cosmos. It influences every plane from the spiritual right on down through to the material, in spite of what the Sheldrake-deniers might like to believe.  
And on a different note, in thinking about the atoms and different polygons, I got to thinking about how each of the vertices (corners) of the polygon is a point where it is being acted upon by one of the tangential forces.  The force is pulling on it at that point and deforming it into a new shape.  This made me think about various times in my life when I have felt pulled in many different directions, with so many different needs motivating me to try to take action, or preventing me from taking action.  My desire for stability, food, sex, love, mental stimulation, belonging, power etc. are really just the various forces acting on me, which I mistake as ‘my’ own desires.
I have no idea if that is what she is actually getting at here.  This is a tough row to hoe.

Can I use the metaphor and symbolism of an atom in this manner..
Atoms can combine with other atoms to create molecules.  Just as oxygen can combine with carbon to create CO2 or with another atom of oxygen to create O2, there are many things in life which may have similar roots, connections, and/or patterns which appear on the outside to be very different.  A real life example is spirituality.  Christianity and Islam are often at loggerheads today, yet they are both spiritual paths yet which had some similar roots.  The same could likely be said for a great many other spiritualilities.

Onething, which process did you have in mind?  I’m not at all sure I understand.

Peter, interesting. I do the same thing, although I may be beginning and ending from different points than your friend did, and get a very different result.
Stefania, it seems to me that you’re doing a fine job unpacking Fortune’s metaphors. Keep at it! 
Prizm, the great thing about a metaphor is that you can use it anywhere it fits, and see how much sense it makes. What you’ve suggested sounds reasonable enough to me.

Re the Net of Indra- I’d never heard of the metaphor before, but I immediately recognized the description as very closely related to the image I picture during the SoP ritual during Spirit Within, when I’m envisioning myself at the center of the world. The net I imagine is reddish, like nerve cells or veins, perhaps, and the pearls are more like pulsing nodes, but each one is intimately connected to all the others. So I see myself as the center of this infinite net, sharing vital connection with all the other nodes, uniquely myself and at the same time just another node on the network from perspective of all the other unique nodes at the center of their own universes. Another metaphor to explore- thanks!

The set track phenomenon explains why it is so much easier from a movie marketing perspective to prop up endless sequels instead of taking a chance on an original story.  Audiences seem to prefer familiarity to the unknown, almost at any cost.  Pop music is insufferable because it relies upon simple, formulaic dirges bleated out by a rotating array of young, interchangeable faces — the “groove” has been set, and of course pop music is more about entertainment than music.  Political dynasties take a set track and apply the theory in expectation that the pundit apple does not fall far from the father or mother tree.

Pursuant to our dialogue on natural law: 
you say, “I’ve thought more than once of building an argument for Burkean conservatism on the basis of The Cosmic Doctrine — political and cultural institutions and customs have their own deeply rutted “tracks in space,” and settle into an equilibrium which from time to time gets disrupted by changes in the wider cosmos.”
Here’s a fundamental related point so obvious it may seem insulting to make it, but yet it needs to be made: a point which, if accepted (as common sense suggests it ought to be), would blow today’s pseudo-“liberalism” sky-high:
The burden of proof should lie upon the innovator, or upon the new fashion, rather than upon the upholder of tradition. 
It’s not much to ask, and it reasonably leaves open the route to justified change.  But the libberoids’ “we’re upholding the self-evident right to marry our pet gerbils” (or whatever the next thing may be), “so shut up or we’ll call you a bigot”, would no longer hold sway.

I have noticed the effects of the tracks in space in at least one modest way.  I have a friend who is diligently working on creating a plastic free life.  She has gone to great lengths to achieve this and to convince others through setting up demo tables and by her own actions of the wisdom of this path.  Just recently I started thinking about how to create a take out and leftover food kit that didn’t include any plastic.  My friend does this with stainless steel tiffins and I am using pyrex containers.  Out of the blue, another friend, who seldom sees the first friend, started doing the same thing with wooden and ceramic containers.  I was quite surprised, but now I think I can understand this a little bit better.  
In trying to reinforce this “track”, I have been making every effort to not get takeout food that isn’t put in my own non plastic containers or use single use plastic objects.

JMG, Thank you!
Without your gentle insistence that there was a lot to be found in this book, I would never have persevered on to the third attempt and moderate success.
The key for me was in spending the time to create the mental images as close to the description in the text as I could make them. Noticing that the text constantly swaps back and forth between a 2 dimensional description  to a 3 dimensional description I created the images required for each line of text. That means often having two or three mental images for the one concept, then as I read I have the exact image for the text seeing spheres where it mentions spheres or a disc and rings if that is called for.
Reading through a chapter now I have this vibrant accompaniment of images morphing between dimensions, spinning and flowing. I can feel the pull of the opposing forces, the feeling of balance, the gentle flow of the rays and the sharp angular turns of the atoms. Now two surprises, the first one is that even with all the mental images swirling around, the meaning of the text becomes crystal clear, not the illogical mess that I first encountered. The second surprise is that when I have finished reading, I am left feeling like my brain has had a work out, but not tired, just stimulated. The wild ride just as promised!
The idea of visualizing a concept then having it constantly change perspective as from 2D to 3D then to a negative shape, is one I first encountered in classical art training. It serves to flip you from your everyday mode of thinking into the mode of thinking you need to be able to paint and draw.  That seems to be the same mode of thinking required for this book.
Special thank you to the commentary team here, I have been reading your thoughts from the lurkers gallery. The spontaneous outburst of poetry was amazing.

 Dan Mullen says: 



								September 14, 2018 at 12:10 pm							




Thanks for the idea of The Net of Indra. I had not heard of it, and will give it some thought. What is also puzzling to me is the concept of the Ring Cosmos/Ring Chaos pair (Good/Evil) that is Spirit/Matter (Chapter 2). This pair of Cosmos/Chaos would mean that our Spiritual self is of the Ring Cosmos while our physical body is of the Ring Chaos. Our Spiritual self is then surrounded by the Ring Pass Not, which would not allow it to communicate with our physical being, “even in thought.” My personal experience is that my higher self can communicate with my lower, physical self. Maybe it is the consciousness of the larger Ring Cosmos that I am a part of that is doing the communication? The other concepts about the Ring Chaos, that it is the springboard from which good may jump to higher planes makes sense from the concept of evolution from life to life. Still much for me to meditate on here.

A request – OT but perhaps not entirely so: a few British and Irish readers past and present have established contact and hope to meet in London. (You will be welcome for a beer if only it can be possible in spirit!) 
The numbers have been helped by Matt who ran the London EEE course conference 2014 to whom you gave a talk when you were over here. He has established a private email list and a number of the previous EEE course attendees have come on board to join the relatively fewer number who contacted me when I previously put up a notice on this / your blog a few weeks ago.
One person has pointed out that it was only luck she found the notice of a proposed London meeting and was able to contact me. Can we give it another try?
We are tentatively looking at November perhaps in the first quarter of the new moon starting 7th November but would welcome anybody wanting to join the discussion on the new email list. My contact email lightly disguised is philsharris2002 followed by the usual ‘at’ yahoo.co.uk.
Very best

So… movement begets movement and yet again. Spinning ring begets rings, and rings turn over. Movement generates more movement, of a different kind yet still movement. Moving rings beget moving rays beget more rings, always moving but not quite the same. Action creates swirls and whorls, ever more movement. 
Pushed and pulled by bigger forces, a movement draws a matching movement, consonance. One winds around the other because the other is there and the same. Spiraling together, leading the way, carving a track, pulling more into the choreography until one may become ten, moving in accordance with the prime movement. Attraction, followed and following, prime atoms laying down paths and trails for others to follow.
It’s just one huge, enormous, vast dance!!
Along those lines, I have created several movements that correspond to the various chapters of the Cosmic Doctrine. This has occurred spontaneously as I have read and attempted to understand the text. Once put together, these movements could become a dance someday. Did anyone ever choreograph a movement piece using the CosDoc as inspiration?
As for tracks in space, new following old, and pattern correspondences, I have a couple of anecdotes:
First, I used to do a lot of what is called ‘Authentic Movement.’ This consists of a group of people with one person functioning as the witness. All others begin somewhere in the space (a dance studio so no furniture or other encumbrances) with eyes closed. You just wait. You don’t try to do anything in particular. You don’t try to “dance.” You stay open to what wants to move, maybe it’s a finger, maybe it’s a toe, or an arm, a leg, ribs, whatever, could be anything. And you just let that happen and develop into more movement (or not). You try not to let your mind get in the way too much. It’s a very interesting, sometimes intense exploration. The odd thing is that what often happens is that the movers will frequently end up performing the same or similar movements, coordinated with each other even though they have eyes closed, are not touching or talking. It’s quite uncanny to experience, both as mover and as witness.
Also, some of the Tibetan Buddhist teachers here insist on teaching in Tibetan and having the students learn/recite the sadhanas in Tibetan and Sanskrit. The reasoning is that the pujas (ceremonies) are more potent in these languages because those are the sounds and words that have been used for thousands of years and also because more humans have become enlightened by doing the practices in these languages than in any other language. (Sort of like Latin and the Catholic Mass as Rita Rippetoe mentioned.)
John Michael, thank you so much for bringing the Cosmic Doctrine into my awareness. I have been a student of movement my entire life and am enjoying the text and these discussions immensely, thinking about movement now as the prime cause. Makes my heart sing,
Yanocoches

JMG,
You say modern science insists that all material events must have a material cause. I certainly believe that, but I was not aware that science did. It seems to me that if you believe this way, you can’t really have existence without an uncaused, self-existent something. I mean, how would the first matter get started without prior matter?
So when I say that I believe that way, I only mean once the ball is rolling. Materiality itself must have an “other” cause.
I have a lot of trouble with the concept of nonmaterial. I prefer to divide reality up into that which has some type of existence, and that which does not (and the latter doesn’t really exist). Is it possible to exist and have no substance at all? I am skeptical. 
I believe that humanity got into the habit of describing the mysteries as spiritual and nonmaterial, (because it looks that way) but it was an error.







 Robert Mathiesen says: 



								September 14, 2018 at 8:43 pm							




@onething on the non-material:
Consider, if you will, being in love.  If you examine the body of someone both before and after they have fallen in love, there will definitely be material changes: in muscle tone, in posture, in patterns of blood flow, in hormonal activity, in pheromonal activity, and in many other bodily habits and processes.  But these material changes will also differ from one person to another, sometimes in degree, sometimes in other ways.  And that is the first step in the argument I wish to make here.
The second step is to observe that “being in love” is not wholly a subjective, imaginary thing.  One can easily notice if one’s friend has fallen in love since the last time you saw them, even if the friend has said nothing about it to you.  There is no single clue; there is no invariant set of clues; and also on occasion you may be wrong about your friend’s being in love.  Yet, for all that, a friend’s being in love is a thing that on can detect through the use of one’s ordinary, quite material sense-organs.
The third step is to observe that “being in love” with a friend can–and usually will–produce some sort of emotional resonance in that friend.  Your love may be reciprocated, either quickly or over time, slowly.  Or the resonance may tend in the opposite direction: your being in love may strongly repel your (former?) friend.
So “being in love” is definitely not an imaginary thing: it has real consequences in the material world that you share with other humans.  In this it is unlike–for example–the imaginary world into which one enters when one reads compelling fiction by oneself, fiction that is very much to your taste, but not really to the taste of any of your friends.
However, even if it is not an imaginary thing, “being in love” is not–in and of itself–a material thing, either.  To be sure, it has material correlates, but these are not the same thing as material causes that invariably produce “being in love” as their deterministic effect.  “Being in love” is not the sum of the above-mentioned material changes in the body and physiology of the person who has fallen in love.  Any number and combination of those material correlates may be lacking from the body of this or that person who is in love.  There is no straightforward way in which “being in love” can follow as an effect invariably caused by those changes in the body.
Indeed, a human can even learn how to “fall out of love” by choice, though this is a rather hard skill to master–especially since many people doubt even the bare possibility of developing that skill–and it requires much practice.  It is, however, quite a useful skill to cultivate, in case one falls in love with a person who does not reciprocate your love, or even (as sometimes happens) is powerfully and visceral repelled by your love.
So … if “being in love” is neither a purely material thing nor a purely imaginary thigh, what is it exactly?  It appears to be some third kind of thing, half-way between the material and the imaginary.  One profound scholar, Henri Corbin, felt the need to name this third kind that we encounter in ordinary life.  He categorized such things as “being in love” by the new word, imaginal.  Like imaginary things, imaginal things lack any material existence; but like material things, imaginal things necessarily have effects in the world of material existence.
This three-way distinction is (IMHO) extraordinarily useful as one comes to grips with occult, esoteric and magical teachings and practices.  The “tracks” of which we have been speaking in these comments, for one example, can be understood as imaginal things, neither imaginary nor material.
And, by the way, time and space are almost certainly the dimensions within which “matter” and “energy” (as physicists use these terms) necessarily exist; but non-material things, whether imaginal or imaginary, are not necessarily so constrained.  It is only since Descartes that we have become accustomed to think that time and space are universal dimensions on which all existence can be located, not merely material existence.  
Medieval and Late Antique philosophers (and theologians) were absolutely certain that there was existence apart from time and space, and they had very many powerful arguments for their certainty.  There was, in this existence outside of time and space, a sort of variability for which our best human term is in the inadequate word, “change,” but that sort of “change” did not involve any movement through either time or space.
Does that help with some of the difficulties you mention?







 Robert Mathiesen says: 



								September 14, 2018 at 9:05 pm							




As for the effects of rituals carried out in the same way over centuries, in ancient sacral languages (Greek, Latin, Church Slavonic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Tibetan, Sanskrit, Avestan, etc. etc.):  
It may be of some interest that the Orthodox Churches–I speak as an outsider, of course–explicitly teach that when a priest and congregation celebrate the Eucharist [i.e., the Mass], what they do is not merely a sequence of words and deeds performed at a particular time and place on earth, but also by those same words and deeds they co-celebrate the Eucharist together with the Saints and Angels around the Throne of God in a realm wholly outside of time and space, without any confusion of tongues.  
Thus the “track” of the Eucharist in imaginal space, if we may so term it, was as deep in the 1st and 2nd centuries of the Christian Era as it now is and as it ever will be, since there is no distinction between “was” and “is” and “will be” in the sacral realm.  (For all I know, the Catholic Church may well teach the same thing, and the other Eastern Churches, too.)  
For the Orthodox Churches, see Vladimir Lossky’s “The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church” and Alexander Schmemann’s “Introduction to Liturgical Theology”–two works by Orthodox theologians which greatly enhanced my understanding of the imaginal realm.

@onething – re: science and its insistence on the material…
A Buddhist might say that rather than it being the case that consciousness appears from within the material (e.g., the brain), it is the brain — as well as the entire cosmos — which appears within consciousness. It seems that something like telepathy, for example, is made possible if this were true. This takes us right into the realm of the non-material as being foundational in a primary way.
There may be a few cognitive turns that some minds need to make in order to access this sense of truth, but I can recommend that they look up someone like Bernardo Kastrup, who is currently one of the bright lights giving materialists a “solid” challenge. He provides a good indication of the limits in which science is currently stuck in their attempts to solve the “hard problem” of consciousness, and his own theory of a Mind-at-Large with many alters, has been carefully (he would say parsimoniously) worked out and is worth checking out.
Recently he’s been getting published in peer-reviewed journals, and this recent article in Scientific American has been causing some stir…

I note that you yourself have considered this matter and I salute your efforts which were timed really well (from my perspective anyway). Did Dion Fortune ever encounter the inverted bell shape curve which I reckon we all travel?
I mean can we as a species create a track that is ill advised, and can we shake off the effects of that? Dunno.

@ Robert Mathiesen on the Eucharist:  most interesting.  Following on: I should think it must be the Catholic as well as the Orthodox view that the totality of all celebrations of the Eucharist forms a single, eternal and unified 4-D event, perceived as different celebrations from our limited viewpoint in linear time.  That does away with the Protestant objection that it’s a “re-enactment” of Christ’s sacrifice. Rather than a re-enactment, each occasion is supposed to be a faceted manifestation of the original event.  (I say all this as a Protestant myself.  I don’t have to believe in an idea, to appreciate that it makes sense in its own terms.)

One last thought about the spirit/matter good/evil pair. If our physical universe, matter, is part of the Ring Chaos, the laws that apply to it, such as entropy, the tendency to dissolution,disorder, and devolution, are the opposite of those that would apply to the spiritual realm that is part of the Ring Cosmos. The spiritual part of creation, the Ring Cosmos, would have opposite tendencies towards evolution and contraction to the center. It seems that when we are observing something, we must first decide if we are looking at its Ring Cosmos or Ring Chaos aspect before we decide how to apply such laws as “As Above so Below” and “The Law of Correspondences.”

Heather, excellent. By all means work with that. 
Kimberly, yes, all those are good examples. And of course the people who make movies are just as strongly affected by the tracks in space as the people who watch them…
Robert, I’m not at all sure I’d agree to a strict assignment of the burden of proof to either side in any strict sense — how on earth could you prove in advance, say, what the consequences of Brexit would be? — but you’re certainly right to critique the way that blind faith in progress is abused by social justice activists. It’s a fine bit of absurdist comedy to watch, as they equate “I want this” to “I have a right to this” to “this is the next inevitable step on the onward march of justice, because we say so, that’s why”  and finally to “if you dare to even ask questions about this, that proves that you’re personally responsible for every bad thing that ever happened to anyone anywhere.” 
Kay, that’s a great example. Thank you. 
Zebby, delighted to hear it. The images really do matter; if you just read the text, it’s pretty opaque, but if you approach it as Fortune instructs, it opens any number of doors. 
Phil K., bingo. 
Dan, where do you get the idea that the physical body is the Ring-Chaos? It’s influenced by the Ring-Chaos, which is why it changes so constantly and finally dies, but it’s within the Ring-Pass-Not. 
Yanocoches, you’re most welcome and thank you.
Onething, fair enough. It depends very much on what you mean by “material.” In occult philosophy, everything that exists takes form in some kind of substance, but the substance we call “matter” is merely the densest, most obvious, and most recalcitrant kind of substance there is. 
Robert, that certainly fits the conception Fortune presents! 
Simo, er, about The Cosmic Doctrine? Or what? 
Chris, hmm.  What do you mean by “freshness”? 
Phutatorius, good! 
Changeling, thank you — another set of good examples. 
Coboarts, I’m not at all sure how the seven rays of Theosophy would fit in Fortune’s system, which is a little odd, since she received a lot of her basic training from the Theosophists. 
Dan, and as long as you remember that all of this takes place within the Ring-Pass-Not, and is part of the Ring-Cosmos (while influenced from time to time by the Ring-Chaos), that would work.

Hi John Michael,
Ah! An introduced term with no clear definition. Apologies for that, it was not intended as a critique and perhaps I was a bit self absorbed in the question. 🙂 Nope, I was thinking about how I can keep writing for over a decade, whilst maintaining a core theme, but somehow keeping the stories ‘fresh’ i.e. Maintaining interest. I tend to write about the small events and there are plenty of those. If I wrote about the big things and currents, well I’d quickly run out of material for stories and generate a lot of opposition. Best to go with the flow…
As for the tracks, I feel that we can benefit from those, but generally we might be well advised to direct our energies into the realms of theurgy as that would be of benefit to us as a species on the longer term. As a species we’re a bit all over the shop at the moment, but we will get there I reckon.

The point about tracks in space would then apply to systems of magical timing, no? If magicians have been following “This lunar day is good for X, Y, or Z,” the repeated performance of rites related to X, Y, or Z would only be reinforced. 
That makes me wonder how much calendars of magical timing are built into the fabric of things and how much is reinforcement from repeated action, going back to some hypothetical point of a spirit or deity telling a magician in the mists of time to first perform an action at a certain point. But I suppose for it to really be stronger, you would also have to be following the actions specifically tied to that system of timing to get the most bang.
And that means one would eventually have to settle for one form of timing to line yourself up with those tracks.

Hi JMG
It is very hard for me try to learn from this world of occultism, but anyway I like the ideas of Mr Sheldrake a lot of what he says “resonate” with my inner mind
Talking about the materialistic worldview, in fact all the religion born in the “Axial Era” are fully drenched in the materialistic worldview in an unconscious way, as the fishes do not know they are swiming in “water”. This an example I have taken from David Graeber about this issue: 
Maurice Leenhardt, a catholic missionary who in the 20s of the last century was preaching christianity in New Caledonia, among very “backward” (“savage”) tribes, one of the times he asked one of his students, one Boesoou, how he had felt when he first heard (as he thought) “spiritual” ideas, this is how the missionary describes himself:
“Once, anxious to assess the mental progress of the Kanaks whom I had been teaching for years, I risked the following suggestion:” In short, have we introduced the notion of spirit into your way of thinking? ” He replied: «Spirit? Bah! You did not bring us the spirit. We already knew that the spirit existed. We had always acted according to the spirit. What you brought us was the body »”
Likewise, the rest of nature is now shown to them (to the “savages”)  as “objects” separate from us and totally lacking of “spirit,” which becomes, now, merely as “things” to be used, dominated, bought….
All the missionary teachers in fact were teaching a new set of materialistic worldview fully embedded in the concepts and notions of an (Axial) Era of markets, money abstraction and rationality, today as it was in the V century b.c.
“Rationalism” derived from “ratio” which is, at the end, a quantitative relation between numbers; and all this worldview arise when abstract markets and money take a dominant position in society
Pythagoras says: “things are numbers”, and Xenocrates (4th century BC), a fine observer, manages to glimpse the relationship between markets and Pythagorean thought when saying:
“Pythagoras more than anyone seems to have honored and advanced in the study of numbers, snatching their use to merchants and equating all things to numbers” (as the merchants, in fact, do)
Because a feature of markets and money is the capacity of converting the qualitative to quantitative, to erase the differences in the name of abstraction and defining the world in terms of “building blocks”
For example Thomas Hobbes was one of the defenders of Atomism in the XVII century and I think caused by the impact of markets and money in the worldview of the Era that bring also Atomism in classic Greece (or classical India or China), and also was a proponent of the “algorithmic nature” of language that convinced Leibnitz to try to “decipher” the code of language, in another renewed futile attempt, as was those of Wittgenstein or today AI, or the idea of “algorithmic nature” of the mind
The concept of “Natural Law” in my opinion was the fundamental concept that bring the development of the Modern Science; and its origin is in the “predestinationism” of the protestant faith which is something quite new and a fundamental difference with the concept used in classical Greece’s “science”
IMHO is the protestant faith and the set of its new concepts (predestinationism, justification only by the faith, laic calling, etc…) that bring us the development and total prevalence of Modern Capitalism and Modern Science
For example Rene Descartes’ teacher was the dutch philosopher and physicist Isaac Beeckman, who came from a family with strong calvinist convictions, and it was he who introduced Descartes to the scientific foundations of mechanics and the notion that, using mathematics, the problems of physics should be able to be solved (which presupposes a pre-determination of the events). In addition Descartes lived during the time of his youth and maturity in Holland, in the midst of a strongly calvinist social and intellectual environment that brought the “Clockwork Universe” to us
Compare this ideas with that of the Humanists (in the catholic world) as Bernardino Telesio, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella or Giambattista della Porta that see the universe as a living entity formed by living entities in all the scales
For example Giambattista della Porta says “… with the suffering of one part, the rest of the cosmic entity suffers …” and also says “… since the universe is a living creature, in all parts the masculine and the feminine are coupled by the reason of mutual love … ” . Or Giordano Bruno who says: “… this earth, divine motherthat has generated us and feeds us and that later it will welcome us again ”
And thousands of other texts that see the Universe and the Earth as living creatures and with the same idea about the impact of changes in one part affect all
May be now we are starting to “regressing” to them in this long decadence
Cheers
David

Thanks, JMG and the commentariat, for this week’s discussion and exploring the “groove” concept. And Sheldrake’s concept of (and experiments proving) Morphic Resonance certainly support this concept. I found it interesting that the “sow a thought” saying has its source in New Thought. Interestingly, CosDoc’s statement the concept of eternal tracks in space is echoed by some Hindu teachings that warn us to watch our words because “every word we speak echoes in akash (space) forever” and explains how important the recitation of the Vedas are to raise the level of our species’ consciousness as a whole because it affects everyone (and attributes our present “dark age” of spirituality to the vast reduction in Vedic recitation in recent centuries). 
One thing from this week’s reading, however, doesn’t seem to have been discussed is the passage: “There are already worked out in the Cosmos the great lines of force which we call the Rays, and the currents of the Rays would gradually influence the great oceans of rebounding atoms to follow in their tracks” (page 34, Millennium Edition). I may have missed it in previous discussions, but I am wondering exactly what these “currents of the Rays” might be. Being 12 in number, I automatically think of the pattern of the 12 signs of the Zodiak, but there may be something else there. As a Hindu, I see the world as a pattern of the 3 basic qualities of creation (light/activity/creation, darkness/sloth/dissolution, and a balance of the two that transcends them and maintains the universe) which are embodied in the trinity Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. Perhaps each culture perceives the “Rays” differently?
Finally, one comment that I was too late in posting from last month’s comments for you to respond to (and therefore hope to get a response this month). I happened to be reading Hall’s “The Secret Teachings of All Ages” and near the end of the chapter “Qabbalistic Keys to the Creation of Man” (p.352 in the edition I am reading, to be exact) I came across the phrase “Ring Pass -Not”! The context is the banished Adam not being allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum due to a cherub swinging a flashing sword in a circle. Now, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages” was published in 1928 and I believe that CosDoc was accessible only to Fortune’s inner circle of students between 1924 and 1949. Would I be right in assuming that Manly P. Hall was “well connected” to Dion Fortune in the 1920s? If not, it seems to be quite a coincidence!

I am not sure I agree with the idea that everything takes place “within the Ring Cosmos.” In chapter 4 we read:
“Dances of atoms give rise to new Rings-Cosmos, and the story begins again, these new universes, as they are called, while they have the same laws as the Cosmos before described, are also influenced by that framework of the Cosmos which was built before they began, and you will find that this law holds good throughout all manifestation.”
What this means to me is that there is a fractal nature to the Ring Cosmos/Ring Chaos picture of creation. We are constantly interacting with other Ring Cosmos/Ring Chaos universes as we go about our lives; each person is a Ring Cosmos/Ring Chaos universe. This nicely explains phenomenon such as why it is so hard to create lasting relationships. Our tendency is to start relationships based on material factors, which are part of the Ring Chaos and therefore dissipative in nature. Being dissipative, the energies are the opposite of what a long lasting, permanent relationship should be based upon. It is not until we see people from their Ring Cosmos perspective that we find what we are looking for in a relationship. Yes we all live within a greater Ring Cosmos, so from that perspective all takes place “within the Ring Cosmos.” But I find it useful to think that we are also interacting with Ring Cosmos/Ring Chaos universes that are part of greater Ring Cosmos/Ring Chaos universes as we live out our lives.

An addendum to my earlier comment: it must be quite apparent that the 3 qualities (gunas) that form the bedrock of Hindu cosmology fit well within the rubric of Cosmos, Chaos, and Ring-Pass-Not; for the 12 Rays I was thinking of things as being rather fractal – i.e., these three principles being within Cosmos itself. The process of multiplicity arising from these 3 principles is described in the Hindu scripture Pradhanika Rahasya, in which each of these 3 principles (Gods) is paired with a Goddess who has a different quality and their pairings lead to all the activity of the Universe (this description is super-highly condensed because I don’t want to hijack this commentary; besides, I’m not sure how many within the commentariat are “into” Hindu cosmology. I will say in passing that I see so much Vedic wisdom in CosDoc, just using Western occult terminology.

Dear Archdruid,
“Any pattern of movements that establishes itself as a steady rhythm becomes a foundation on which later realities must build.”
I’ve been doing a lot of reading on Shintoism again lately, and I’m astonished at the many similarities between (some lineages of) Shinto and Revival Druidry. And there are very many; from the division of Spirits Above and Below, to the Elements, to the disinclination to prosthelytize… Not to mention the similarity between the constructions of the actual Ancient Druids (or their ancestors) and very similar structures found in Japan. Shintoism might well be related.
It’s becoming clear to me that Revival Druidry would naturally gravitate towards something close to what had been practiced in these lands before, that it would be guided into that direction by the established pattern of movements.
It also clears up to me how how Druidry practiced elsewhere (such as in America), would ultimately take forms suitable to the patterns for nature religions that were already established there in ages past – it will probably take on something akin to Native American-esque aspects, regardless of whether this is ever the intention of the practitioners, because those established patterns will sway the development of these systems in the long run.
Revival Druidry may have started as an eccentric Anglican-Christian fraternity movement, it was inevitable that it would absorb some of the occult history of europe, and gravitate ever more towards ‘historical’ nature religions.
(Not to say they are the same, of course. Western Europe is not Japan, and neither is America. That is sort of the key point here.)
Am I on the right track here?
– Brigyn

Robert Mathiesen,
The issue is, you have argued from the position that there is a material and nonmaterial reality. I don’t know that I accept this. All that has existence exerts affects. What then can it mean to call it nonmaterial? We do not know what the mind or soul is made of, but we see more and more that there are things which exist that are very subtle. Is there a point at which something exists yet has no substance? If so, how can it exert affects? Matter must be ‘touched.’
I agree with your analysis so far as it goes. I can certainly see that a thing in the mind’s eye has less density than a chair, but I don’t see emotion as imaginal and nonmaterial. Even thoughts have substance, and probably the soul; consciousness itself I am not sure.

Re the “burden of proof” – you’re right, JMG, and I admit I was being lazy in my use of the phrase; what I should have said was, “the burden of argument”.  That’s to say, it’s up to the innovator to show some reason why one should jump from one set of assumptions (A) to another set (B), and that reason cannot itself merely be justified in terms of B if it’s to be any use in justifying the transition from A.  It must – if it’s to function plausibly – take some notice of the original as well as of the destined view, and thus construct an over-arching philosophy (C).
Therefore it’s no use pretending that fashionable views are self-evident.  For instance, a view that only began to prevail in the 1960s may or may not be true, but it’s far, far too late to claim that it’s self-evident.

No doubt someone else will have mentioned this before I post, so please excuse my duplicating ideas.
It occurred to me that if you were to swap out the word “atom” in your essay this week for the word “archetype”, everything you said about the atom rings true of archetypes in my mind.
An archetype is not a lone movement, it necessarily occurs along with something else (I may be wrong but I can’t think of an example.)  Each movement must have something else that defines it: the nurturer needs something to nurture or it is not a nurturer, the consumer needs something to consume, the changer needs to change something, the lover and the beloved, the leader and the follower, the reformer and the situation/person needing reformation, the joker and the victim, and so on.
This necessary duality sets up a vortex that can move like a water spout through a society, some playing the one, others playing the other, but always spinning around each other, dependent on the other for its play in the archetype, and together creating a vortex. This vortex then attracts others that move in a similar way, and becoming stronger, flows throughout society in waves. 
Moreover, in order to play out the archetype, it may be necessary to bring in yet another “atom”. For example, in order for the protector to play the part to the vulnerable, there must be something that threatens the vulnerable. Other factors brought in to the picture would increase the shape from triangle to square, and so on, and away they spin. 
As the archetype moves from the centre to the ring-pass-not, under the influence of the ring-chaos, it can also become more and more evil, then come back to good as it flips and flows back towards the centre. Love may become possessive and jealous, nurturing becomes smothering, etc. Because like the  atoms in this chapter, the archetypes are subject to other forces, cultural norms, environments, personal factors, and so on. Love is played out in a culture where men dominate women and fight each other, poverty limits time and resources, and so on. And as it moves through the circles, it becomes more and more complex.
I could go on with my comparisons, but you get the idea.

@Mac, the phrase “got it in one” literally means “you got the correct answer in only one try.” It’s often said by teachers in classroom settings (and in situations analogous to that) to mean a student’s answer to a question was correct. There’s an additional implication that the question was of a difficult or tricky nature such that the students might have been expected to make some wrong guesses first. In more general usage it means “you made a very good point” or “your observation or conclusion is valid.”
Does that help clear things up?

I don’t think our bodies or the universe are either of the ring cosmos or chaos. Rather, the ring cosmos represents the Organizational Force – that which takes the void of potential and turns it into concrete things with numbers and elements and mathematics. The ring chaos is the dissipative force, or entropy. The ring chaos is context within which the ring cosmos creates content (order).

I’m starting to wonder if something like heroin addiction is an example of following a track in space set by other addicts.  The process of shooting up is very ritualistic after all.  I remember Raymond Chandler discussing his alcoholism, and describing how the best moment for him was surveying the bar before ordering his first drink, and looking at all the shiny bottles and mirrored glass.  This seems to have been the habit he had fallen into, rather than the alcohol itself.
Addiction I would guess is simply a harmful habit that is “sticky” because that particular track in space (rut in space?) is very comfortable while you are in it.  Is one of the implications of Fortune’s idea that almost everything is a mild form of addiction?  We are nothing if not habit-forming creatures.

“I don’t see emotion as imaginal and non-material.”
Indeed, emotions are not imaginal and non-material.  But what reasons do you have for thinking that “being in love” is an emotion?  This view strikes me as really odd.  (It is a view that lots of people hold?)  
To me, “being in love” hardly seems like an emotion at all, or even much like a biological drive such as lust.  
“Being in love” seems to me to be an overwhelming change-of-state in how one relates to — in how one “knows” — other people, and things that aren’t people, too.  (I use the plural here, but it can be a change-of-state on how one relates to one or a very few such people or things.)  
Sure, there are emotions that usually come along with “being in love” with another human, but if one’s “love” is primarily or only a matter of one’s emotions, then one is not “being in love,” at all, but merely swamped with waves of emotions.  The two things are almost wholly different.  They have very little to do with one another.  As a rule, emotions fade away over time.  Knowing and being-wise, however, do not fade away over time, but become deeper and stronger as the years roll by toward the end of one’s life.
And when I spoke of learning “how to fall out of love by choice,” I was speaking loosely about the emotions that usually accompany “being in love,” particularly in its early stages.  You do that the same way you deliberately “fall out of” anger or rage or any passion.  It’s never easy to do this, of course; otherwise more people would do it.
Basically, you start with something simpler, some particular thwarted desire.  You observe yourself with focussed attention and with the intention of learning how your own emotional life works.  As some emotional response develops in you, divide yourself into parts and make one of those parts dispassionately observe how emotion takes form and develops from one second to the next.  There will be stages in the process, and the emotion picks up strength as it develops until it is stronger than your own self.  Remember what you have observed.  
These stages have physiological correlates, and you can notice them, too.  (You don’t need names for them to notice them.  Wordless noticing works better.  “Words get in the way” here, as they do in almost every aspect of human life that matters deeply.)  Eventually, you will recognize the first tiny physiological changes that lead, say, to lust or to rage a little further down the road.  Just as you can breather slower or faster by choice, or even hold your breath for a while, play with these tiny physiological changes and try hastening or retarding them, or even refusing them altogether.
Then the next time some desire of yours is thwarted and you start down the same road, in the very first seconds of the process, before it picks up too much strength, find a way to turn aside.  It can be as simple as refusing to go further down that road, since you know where it leads.  It can be a little more complex: I didn’t really want that cookie all that badly after all, did I.  It can even be a struggle: I can already see clearly where my desire for that other person’s sexy body will lead, if I don’t let lust blind me, so I refuse to spend any of my mental energy imagining what that desired body looks like underneath its clothes–no matter how much pleasure it brings to imagine that.  
With practice, it gets easier and easier to do that.  You do need practice to master the skill.  So find occasions for that practice: don’t flee desire altogether.  Use small thwarted desires as your first exercises: refuse anger, disappointment, etc.  With time you can move on to greater and stronger desires.
If you start this as a child, you may even have an edge on your peers once the hormones of puberty strike and lust becomes a frequent visitor to your mind.
I think this is a clumsy, somewhat incoherent explanation …  I’m sorry, but I don’t see how to explain the process more clearly.  It was so long ago when I started doing this, and I’ve forgotten just how I built the skill.

Robert Gibson wrote:
“I don’t have to believe in an idea, to appreciate that it makes sense in its own terms.”
Very true.  I’ve learned a lot from studying religions that I could never in a million years bring myself to adopt as my own.  
Also, one’s religion is not always a thing one gets to choose.  Gods sometimes reject a person who respects them and their teaching, and wants be close to them.  That’s OK, too.  
It all comes down to consent in this area of life, just as it does in one’s more intimate human relationships.  No God is obliged to accept any person as an adherent, much less as a lover.  Speaking somewhat hypothetically, I can even posit that there might be people whom no God or Goddess would consent to accept as a follower, perhaps for reasons wholly unfathomable by any philosophy or theology, or perhaps for no reason at all, just Divine whim.  (“Like flies to wanton boys are we to the Gods; they kill us for their sport.”)

I’ve been thinking about the tracks in space concept, and several things occur to me.
First, the concept as so far described is strictly a positive feedback. There must be negative feedbacks balancing it. What are they? What keeps existence from turning into Camazotz from A Wrinkle in Time? Rivers don’t usually just carve themselves deeper and deeper canyons, because phenomena such as erosion and silting force them out of their tracks. Do tracks in space silt up? Wear out? Of course, if things and beings stop following the track, the track could eventually fade away, but that kind of begs the question of why that would happen.
That question got me thinking about opposing patterns/tracks. Let’s suppose a parasite infecting a new host establishes a track that makes it easier for that parasite species to infect that host species in the future, even without adaptive evolutionary changes in the parasite species. But the host’s immune system will fight the parasite, which should establish a track that makes it easier for that host species’ immune system to fight off that parasite species in the future, even without adaptive evolutionary changes in the host species. Would the net results be any different than the same ongoing struggle without such tracks? Especially when the evolutionary changes that do occur are put back into the model?
Or, consider the moon orbiting the earth, establishing its pattern of movements and phases eon after eon. That pattern would become pretty well established and difficult to alter. But the earth’s lunar tides, which gradually transfer kinetic energy from the earth’s rotation to the moon’s revolution, also happen eon after eon, gradually pushing the moon to a more distant orbit, forcing change upon the first pattern. Would this perdurable dance be any different with, or without, tracks in space?
The related question of which phenomena in nature engage in such oppositions (for which the answer appears to be, just about everything) reminded me of Schopenhauer and the primacy of Will, because of the way opposition of different wills is so fundamental to what we perceive as causality. If all is Will, then the tracks in space are really just habits of will or mind. Which I actually find a lot easier to understand and accept than the original metaphor.
Nonetheless, I have to side with the rationalists about Sheldrake’s overall morphic theory (while not condoning any trolling). He might very well be correct about the results and validity of experiments he’s conducted, and that such results require changes in established theory. I hope his proposed study of crystallization of a novel compound gets carried out. 
But the explanation he’s offered so far appears to me to be too general and ad hoc to be accepted as a scientific theory. The problem is, it seems to predict many outcomes contrary to what we observe, which then require special pleading to exclude. For instance, the millionth run of the same pattern-generating computer program does not run any faster than the first one did. (Yes, this has actually been tested, not just dogmatically assumed.) “Of course not,” proponents say, “a computer processor’s speed is controlled by a clock.” But all natural processes occur at rates subject to time-dependent phenomena, from radioactive decay to the rate of diffusion of ions through membranes in nerve cells. There’s nothing special, physically, about a clock. Although I might have missed developments from recent years since I last read Sheldrake’s work, I haven’t seen any explanation clearly distinguishing phenomena that are responsive to morphic fields from those that, like the oscillation of a quartz crystal or the charging of a capacitor through a resistor (effects used in the clocks of computer chips) seem by all evidence not to be. By analogy, Newton’s theory of gravitation would be far less useful or important if, instead of universal gravitation, it stated that the falling of apples means there’s a field that attracts some things to some other things some of the time.

In re: falling out of love, in addition to what Robert Mathiesen said (and he should know, as he’s had to advise me about that a few times over the years!), in my experience it helps to sit down and consciously remember that being with this particular person is not going to solve all your problems, keep you from ever having a bad head cold or an emergency root canal again, or otherwise make life perfect. Following on, remember also that the person in question is mortal and human. Think of their flaws. (If need be, picture them sitting on a toilet after bad seafood.) Think of how what seemed like minor flaws could get really irritating in other relationships.
In essence, unrequited love/infatuation is a matter of imbalance–both in your feelings as compared to the other person’s, or your feelings about the other person as compared to who they really are, how they would fit into your life, how many other compatible people are out there, etc. Falling out of love is a matter of restoring balance, perspective, and/or context. You don’t need to hate them (and probably shouldn’t, except in cases of abuse–not loving you back isn’t a crime or a sin) but it can be really helpful to take a moment and think that (in various of my own cases) well, yes, he’s very attractive, but he’s a total flake about plans/he talks about pro wrestling way too much/he wears white briefs on dates/he can’t wash a dish to save his life.* Nothing major, nothing that makes the other person a Bad Person, but–scrape those feet until you hit clay, and life will be easier for you.
That said: in my experience, barring cases of serious bad treatment, you’re almost never going to be completely indifferent to the person in question. An ex of mine from high school IMed me the other day; it’s been sixteen years since we were involved, it’s unlikely to happen again for a variety of reasons, I’ve been able to follow his social media posts of family etc. for years without feeling anything other than happy for him (and sometimes impressed by how well he’s kept in shape, granted), and I’ve loved and lost at least five men since, but I still got a little thrill, and a daydream or two. In fact, while I haven’t pined for any of my exes in years, there’s only maybe two who I wouldn’t spend a night or so with, were they around and inclined.
To tie back into the actual subject of this post, we establish these patterns between people as well. Using, if not hate, at least considerable exasperation, as a thrust-block can help a great deal, as can the methods Robert Mathiesen recommends, but the patterns are always going to be there. Even when they *do* end up negative, and you never want to see that person again, that pattern is going to be a thing that happened, and a thing that influences you going forward. The best you can do is register, mitigate, and work around it–again, in my experience.
This has been your semi-regular Drunken Spinster Romantic Advice.
* Actually, if you really want to get over someone, wait a couple years and then have him as a platonic roommate. Yowza.

I was struck by the section of the text that reads
“Space, when set in motion, never stops flowing because it is frictionless. A force has been generated which remains. This force may be blended with other forces, so that for all practical purposes it ceases to be a separate unit, yet it still retains its original character, and, could you analyze the unit of which it forms a part, you would find it there intact.”
This passage instantly brought to mind the wobbly 16 mm film I had been shown in graduate school to demonstrate  “Laminar Flow” (several examples now on youtube) – a frictionless movement of fluids, where blobs of brightly-colored corn syrup are added to a vat of clear corn syrup.  The vat is mixed by slowing turning a paddle clockwise several rotations until all of the colored blobs appear to be blended into the surrounding syrup. Then the paddle is turned the opposite direction an equal number of turns and, lo and behold, the blobs reform, almost exactly to their original form.  It’s uncanny – like watching someone unscramble an egg. The blobs appear to cease to be separate units, yet they retain their original character.  
Fortune states that this concept is the basis of much of practical occultism.  What are some examples of how this concept is applied? It almost seems to have something to do with the perception of time.  If you watched one of these laminar flow examples you would almost swear that after they have mixed the blobs they have simply reversed the film and are running it backwards.

@ isabelcooper (& Robert M)
re tracks in space and falling out of love
I don’t want to stretch the topic too far, but I’d like to convey my own experience on the matter, if I may.
The shifting of the patterns can and will take time, particularly in the case of long-established relationships.  Just over a decade ago, I went through something of a gauntlet when a long-term relationship dissolved.  Fortunately, near the beginning of that process, I was granted a vision by Some Higher Power that gave me an anchor for the coming emotional storm.  In a moment of startling clarity, I was standing on a mountain road just as it crested a small rise.  Below me was a valley, filled with a dark and threatening wood, impenetrable to my sight.  The road I was on descended from where I stood and disappeared into the wood.  I could see nothing of its path through that dark place.  But beyond, in the distance and on the other side of the valley, I saw that same road leaving the wood and ascending the valley slope into the light.  And I knew, if I could just keep moving forward on that road, I would eventually emerge.  There were times when that vision quite literally kept me alive.
Keeping things amicable is helpful.  (We divorced ourselves, sans attorneys, and rather impressed the Family Court Administrator who presided over our hearing.)  What helped me, too, was looking at the relationships and the labels associated with them, allowing what no longer applied to go while embracing what remained relevant.  I recall the day I was able to see her and say to myself “She is not my wife.”  However, “mother of my child” never goes away.  We spent the next 10 years cooperatively raising our daughter.  (Apparently doing a descent job of it, by the young adult she is today.)
Again, not meaning to go all Dr. Phil here, but the process is a process and the time and effort required is somewhat proportional to the depth of the pattern being changed.  I learned much from that experience; it has helped me to be a better father to my daughter and a better partner in my current relationship.  And I am quite grateful for that.

@David: That is an excellent way to look at it. “the process is a process and the time and effort required is somewhat proportional to the depth of the pattern being changed”–exactly. And the vision is a good one; one of the phrases I’ve said to myself at such times, and occasionally to others, is “This will hurt, until it doesn’t.” Finding the balance between dwelling on emotions and repressing them is really hard, but really helpful, IME.

Archdruid,
The paths laid down by what has come before are easier to follow. Lord Ganesh, the remover of obstacles, is called such because his earthly kin, the elephants, create elephant roads in the jungle. These paths were easy for a traveler to use. The large size of the elephants, much like the sun and moon, cleave a way through the dense foliage of existence. Follow the movement of large objects in motion to find the best path to ones destination. A properly trained mage can pick and follow the little used paths of existence. The flowering cycle of a single plant during its season can show us a hidden way, if we understand the nature of its motion. 
Ancient civilizations that go through regime changes also changed their calendars because the regimes wanted to forge a new path. Sun kingdoms, moon kingdoms, seasonal kingdoms, and etc…
Regards,
Varun

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: Atomic Evolution upon the Cosmic Planes 
October 10, 2018October 10, 2018John Michael Greer60 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which you can find here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
 
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 5, “Atomic Evolution upon the Cosmic Planes,” p. 27-30.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 4, “The Evolution of the Atom,” beginning with the first complete paragraph on p. 38 (which starts with the words “Evolution on the Cosmic planes…”) and the beginning of Chapter 5, “The Genesis of a Solar System,” ending with the second paragraph on p. 43 (which ends “…start back up the spiral to the Central Sun.”).
 
Commentary:
As with previous chapters it’s probably wise to revisit two points before going on.  First, it’s essential to keep in mind the basic rule Fortune puts at the beginning of the text—“These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are intended to train the mind, not to inform it.”  Second, this is a textbook of occult philosophy, not of physics. When Fortune discusses atoms in this chapter, she’s using the concept of the atom as a metaphor, not talking about atoms as imagined by the scientists of her time, or for that matter of ours.
Too many students of The Cosmic Doctrine lose track of this basic rule somewhere in these early chapters, and end up trying to force Fortune’s metaphor to fit current scientific notions of atomic structure, or vice versa.  This isn’t helpful at all when you’re trying to make sense of the basic concepts of occult philosophy expressed in terms of visual metaphors—which is after all what we’re doing here.
With this in mind, let’s proceed to the text. At this point in the development of the Cosmos, an immense number of atoms have been generated by the interplay of the forces of the twelve Rays, and begin to drift outward under the influence of centrifugal force. (My copy of the revised edition, dated 1966, has one of my favorite typos in this chapter, in place of centrifugal: “centrifrugal.” I decided many years ago that this refers to people who are too cheap to live in the big city.)
Our text gives us two accounts of the way this works, and they aren’t entirely compatible.  According to the first account, the primal atoms, which are vortices of repeated movement with from three to ten angles, emerge from the Central Sun and fill the first Circle. They then combine with one another to form composite atoms, which are influenced by centrifugal force and drift out to the second Circle. The composite atoms then unite with one another to form more complex atoms, which drift out to the third Circle, and the same process continues until all seven Circles are filled with atoms. The fantastically complex atoms of the Seventh Circle then proceed along the evolutionary track we’ll be discussing next.
The second account focuses not on the complexity of the atoms but of the number of angles in the prime atom around which each composite atom takes shape. In this version, the atoms sort themselves out among the circles based on their number of angles.  The three-sided atoms settle in the First Circle, the four-sided atoms settle in the Second Circle, and so on out to the nine-sided atoms, which take up their station in the Seventh Circle. And the ten-sided atoms? Those are the ones that go on to follow the evolutionary track we’ll be discussing next.
Both these accounts are stated in so many words in the text, and there are specific passages that fit one and not the other—for example, in some places the traveling atoms (the ones that follow the evolutionary track) are described as forming around prime atoms of all different numbers of sides, and in others the traveling atoms are described as forming around ten-sided prime atoms only. This isn’t accidental; Dion Fortune has laid a trap.
It’s a trap you can evade with perfect ease so long as you remember that all the things we’re talking about are metaphors. When Robert Burns wrote—
O my Luve’s like a red, red rose
That’s newly sprung in June:
O my Luve’s like the melodie
That’s sweetly play’d in tune.
—he was using two different similes to communicate the same emotion from different angles. I’ve yet to hear of anyone getting outraged by this and insisting that Burns’ lady friend couldn’t be like a rose and like a melody, since one’s a flower and the other’s a sequence of sounds. Unfortunately such squabbles are far too common when we’re dealing with the intricate metaphors human minds need to use to make any kind of sense of spiritual realities.
That’s the trap. Those who are too prone to take The Cosmic Doctrine as a textbook of physics or cosmology will run into the deliberate contradiction between the two metaphors we’re discussing, and either fling the book across the room because it contradicts itself, or get into a fight with some other student of The Cosmic Doctrine over whether or not the seed-atom at the core of a traveling atom can have less than ten sides. It’s painfully easy, especially at the moment, to imagine Decimalists and Multinumerists shrieking denunciations at each other for falling away from the One True Interpretation of our text, and spending so much time wallowing in the quarrel that they never get around to studying the text. The thing has happened so often…
Fortunately we can sidestep the whole issue by remembering that these are metaphors, and that they can both be good metaphors for a truth that, like all spiritual truths, cannot be grasped by the human mind by any means except metaphor. Here’s one metaphor; here’s another; imagine them both as clearly as possible, think about them, see what sense they make, and then try to get as much of a sense as you can of the structure of consciousness that both metaphors represent.
In both metaphors, we have atoms gradually working their way out from the Central Sun to the seventh Circle, on the edge of the Ring-Pass-Not. So at any given point during this phase of the formation of the Cosmos, you have certain atoms that have settled into their final places, and certain others that have worked their way out from the Central Sun but haven’t yet stopped moving. As they move outward along the tracks of one of the Rays, they absorb the influences of each of the Circles they pass through. Eventually most of them settle into a stable orbit—but not all of the atoms do this.
Whether it’s sheer density or a ten-sided prime atom at the center of their structure that does it, some atoms keep on moving even after they’ve reached the Seventh Circle. Beyond the Seventh Circle, though, there’s nowhere for them to go but the Ring-Pass-Not, and except in certain very special circumstances to be discussed later on, When they reach the outer edge of the Seventh Circle, the Ring-Pass-Not sends them spinning back down the ray toward the Central Sun, and they go straight through and out the other side along the opposite Ray.
When the Ring-Pass-Not sends them back along that Ray, in turn, they reach the Central Sun,  veer a little and go out on a different Ray. This continues until each of the ten-sided traveling atoms has passed out and returned along all twelve of the Rays.  They go outward along each Ray in a straight line, but the Ring-Pass-Not imparts a spin to them, and they make a circular movement on the seventh Circle, and repeat it on every subsequent Circle as they return to the Central Sun, absorbing the influence of each Circle from every side. (All this, remember, is still more metaphor.) Since the atoms themselves consist of nothing but movement in space, and each movement of an atom lays down a track in space that pulls further movement along its trajectory, the result is another immense increase in the complexity of the traveling atoms.
Once a traveling atom has completed the full circuit of twelve Rays, its evolution is finished for the time being, and it settles into temporary stillness in the Central Sun. Once all the traveling atoms have finished the full circuit, a phase of evolution is finished, and the Cosmos as a whole settles into a temporary stillness. As our text points out, this is the third phase in the evolution of a Cosmos. The first is the formation of the Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos, and Ring-Pass-Not; the second is the transformation of the Ring-Cosmos into a disk and the genesis of the twelve Rays, the seven Circles, and the Central Sun; the third is the creation of the atoms and their sorting out by complexity.
In each case, we have an active phase of construction, and then a passive phase of equilibrium in which the patterns of movement created in the active phase settles down into a stable structure. As explained in an earlier chapter, these are governed by the rotation of the Ring-Cosmos relative to the Ring-Chaos.
As the Ring-Cosmos turns toward the plane of the Ring-Chaos, the static condition established at the end of the last cycle breaks up and a new phase of development begins.  As the Ring-Cosmos passes the Ring-Chaos and begins to move away from its plane, the patterns set in motion during the phase of development settle into stability and move toward equilibrium. Then the Ring-Cosmos reaches and passes the point of maximum distance from the Ring-Chaos, and the influence of the latter sets the cycle in motion again.
Apply this same pattern to everyday life, to magical training and practice, or to the cycles of history, and you will find that it makes sense of phenomena that the ordinary linear thinking of our culture leaves unexplained. There is always the period of change in which fresh combinations, permutations, and rhythms of action and reaction unfold, and there is always the subsequent period of rest in which the new forces find their equilibrium and settle into a relative stillness. If you want to make change in any context, you need to allow for intervals of calm between bursts of change.
Lacking those, instead of a rhythm of change and repose, you can count on setting up a rhythm of change and counter-change, in which the imbalances set in motion by too prolonged a movement to one extreme generate an equally prolonged and unbalanced movement to the other extreme—a pendulum motion going nowhere. To avoid this, stop the movement you desire while it still has room to run, so that the rest of the Cosmos can settle into stability around it in its new position, rather than dragging it back the other way. That stability then becomes the thrust-block against which a new round of change can push.
Having reviewed the process by which the turning of the Ring-Cosmos sets the great cycles of the Cosmos in motion, the text briefly notes the previous teachings about the Three Rings, and starts drawing connections between the metaphors of The Cosmic Doctrine and a variety of other concepts from religion, occultism, and science. First, the interactions of the Three Rings are briefly discussed, and compared to the Athanasian Creed, the longest and most intricate of the creeds used in western Christian churches. Here’s the part of it that Fortune is referencing:
“We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.”
Apply the same logic to the Three Rings and Fortune’s point is clear. From the initial movement in space, all Three Rings come into being; while the Ring-Cosmos is in some sense first, the Ring-Chaos second, and the Ring-Pass-Not third, all of them are implied in that original motion, and you can’t have any one of them without the others. Each is an essential part of the whole system that frames the Cosmos.
Fortune’s reference to the Athanasian Creed, though, may also be intended to hint at another part of that document:
“The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding.”
Notice here that the structure of the Christian Trinity is mirrored in the structure of the Three Rings. The Ring-Cosmos, like the Father, comes into being out of nothing—“made of none” is quite an expressive way of putting it; the Ring-Chaos, like the Son, is begotten by the motion of the Ring-Cosmos; and the Ring-Pass-Not proceeds from the interaction of the two other Rings as, in Western Christianity, the Holy Ghost proceeds from the other two members of the Trinity.
(Dion Fortune was herself an Anglican Christian; her book Mystical Meditations on the Collects is a good introduction to that end of her thought. She was also a careful student of early 20th century Rosicrucianism, a widely practiced form of Christian occultism, which she absorbed from her teacher Dr. Theodore Moriarty.  Those of my readers who are familiar with either or both of these traditions will find plenty of points of contact in the chapters ahead.)
So the Rings are compared, if not quite equated, to the Christian Trinity. The Rays are equated to the twelve signs of the Zodiac. The Circles are equated to the seven Cosmic Planes of Theosophical and Rosicrucian teaching. Then, in a sudden leap that seems to leave all talk of metaphors in the dust, it places the Central Sun in astronomical space, at a point somewhere off beyond Alpha Centauri. Once again, Fortune has laid a trap for the unwary; this also is a metaphor, and can and should be explored as such.
Notice, more generally, what our text has done in these paragraphs. Over the last five chapters, Fortune has sketched out an abstract image of the genesis of a Cosmos without connecting it explicitly to any other body of spiritual, philosophical, occult, or scientific ideas. Now, in a few short lines, she hints at a glaaxy of connections—to Christian theology, to astrology, to occult philosophy, and to science. She doesn’t work out these connections in any detail; she simply shows that they are possible, and leaves the rest to her readers—that is to say, to you.
 
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text. There are a lot of images in this chapter, so take your time and try to imagine each one as clearly as you can.
It’s particularly useful in this chapter to take a little while to imagine one of the ten-sided traveling atoms leaving the Central Sun for the first time, drifting straight out along one of the Rays, reaching the Ring-Pass-Not, making a circular movement there, and then moving Circle by Circle back down the rays, making a circular movement in each Circle before returning to the Central Sun. Do this several times in your imagination, and notice whether it gives rise to any other images or ideas.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on November 14. Until then, have at it!

This morning I was so excited for this post that I read the chapter before going to work.  The word movement really found a place in my mind, and was further brought to the fore as I stared out the window watching the trees whipping in the wind.  Atoms had moved along the circles causing a disturbance and now they are seeking some equilibrium.  In my minds eye, I then saw the industrial society we currently live in moving along the path of a ray, bouncing off the ring-pass-not and hurry along another ray as it seeks its equilibrium.  It made sense to me of where many of the ideas you have presented in your blogs have found their framework.  It is making me realize what a great honor it is to be initiated into this perspective of the Cosmos.  How one person can be and make a change.  How everything is a blip in a seemingly predestined plan yet that is only because of the patterns which exist.  Our age and society will be forgotten but there does exist the opportunity to leave behind something of value to help combine with the movement currently happening.  It’s both a very meaningful and unmeaningful perspective.  A seeming paradox.  Always seeking equilibrium which will always move once any other motion begins.

I’ve felt a natural inclination to take a short break between pathworking works to let each settle, for example, integrating water before proceeding to air. It wasn’t intentional, just felt right. I guess that makes sense in light of this chapter.
Help me visualize the circle at the ring-pass-not. I’m seeing the trajectory as a safety pin shape. From the middle of the pin, the atom moves to the ring-pass-not, makes a circle to stabilize and integrate, then returns along the bottom of the disc to the central stillness, out the opposite ray, makes another circle, and comes back to the central stillness.  Whereas trying to continue directly could result in the ring-pass-not slapping it back to retrace its footsteps again and again. Is that close to what Fortune had in mind?

Thank you for this explanation.  I have a minor note on language:  The translation of the Atanasian Creed you quote is slightly different from the one I would expect Dion Fortune to have known.
You quote: “We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence.”  The Book of Common Prayer  has “Substance”, rather than Essence.  (And here we are, back at neo-Platonism.)  I do not have a copy of The Cosmic Doctrine, so I am not sure if Dion Fortune is quoting the Creed–with a slight variation–in which case I’d expect she’s varying it from the normal translation for a reason.

Hello John Michael,
I’ve been reading you for quite a while and have bought (legally and legitimately) several of your books, though due to the complexity of my life at the moment, I will probably not become a magician any time soon, and my divinations have told me as much.  But even if I can’t do, I can learn… and so to my (first-ever here) question.
Fortune compares the Rays to the zodiac.  She also says in the previous chapter that the prime atoms/vortices form by the interaction of the Rays and Circles.  As I understand the zodiac, each sector of space corresponding to one of the signs is associated with or resonates with certain specific thought-patterns.  This suggests then that each Ray has its own unique characteristics.  I am not familiar with the Seven Planes, but it seems likely that each has its own characteristics, possibly like the stations on the Tree of Life or of the Druid year.  
So if that chain of logic is valid, it would seem to imply that there are differences within the population of prime atoms depending on which Ray and Circle interacted to form a particular atom.  Twelve Rays and seven Circles would give 84 possible interactions.  I have no idea what this would mean other than to add a deeper layer of complexity to each composite structure.  Am I on to something, or am I misunderstanding the text?
Thanks for all you do.

This Anglican will have to check out Mystical Meditations on the Collects. I’ve always found the collects shockingly bland, especially when comparing a given day’s collect to it’s proper preface. All Saint’s Day is coming up, and no other day shows this dichotomy more clearly. Thanks!

Eduardo, thanks for catching this! I’ll find time in the next day or two to make a page that includes links to all the Cos.Doc. posts. 
RPC, thanks for catching this as well! I’ve corrected it. 
Prizm, I know the feeling! I’m delighted to hear that the Cos.Doc is helping you make more sense of the world; that’s what it’s there for. 😉
Kyle, that’s more or less my take on what she’s saying. Remember that the atom keeps on making circles as it goes back toward the Central Sun, and only there stops spinning and heads back out in a straight line toward the other side of the Cosmos. 
SamChevre, Fortune doesn’t quote the Creed, she just mentions it — I had to go find the text online. You can download a free copy of The Cosmic Doctrine here. 
Steve, excellent. Yes, that’s implied by the text — and it’s exactly that kind of implication that Fortune wanted students to derive from the text. 
Anthony, I’m neither an Anglican nor any other kind of Christian, so I’m far from qualified to say just now well — or how weirdly — Fortune’s meditations relate to the Collects!  Please let me know; I doubt you’ll be the only Christian in the Anglican tradition who asks me about that.

JMG,
How important do you feel “The Great Conversation” of Western culture is within this ray which Western civilization is moving along?  I get the feeling that there are things which certain beings with greater perspective are aware of which would benefit the Cosmos as it transitions from one evolution to another.  Have you any idea what those things are?  😉

@Eduardo Filipe Freitas Hi mate, if you copy ‘The Cosmic Doctrine’ into the search you’ll get the previous posts 🙂 
@All
 “These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are intended to train the mind, not to inform it.”
So not the literal truth, but something that rhymes? How far do you go with this or any other occult image? I’ve heard JMG talk about how he works well with texts and had a harder time with the image side of things, whereas I’m the complete opposite so the images come quite readily, whereas a struggle with text. If the image I conjurer up while reading is not the ‘real’ thing, but more a hint or clue, what is the ‘real’? something that shares similarity with the conjured image? 
I’ve had to go back to the beginning as I’m getting beyond my self, and rereading the initial chapter, are the ‘ring cosmos’, ‘ring chaos’ and ‘ring pass not’ all look like the sphere of protection ritual. Is this an example of that rhyme? 
Cheers 🙂

The mental connection I made after working out there mental image for the traveling composite atoms was that of reincarnation, with each journey outwards from the central stillness along a ray a metaphor for a life.
On the idea of the contradiction being a trap, it is also a most important skill, to be able to switch metaphors easily. For example not just looking at a social problems in terms of cost, but also needs of the community, then switching again to look from inside the problem as an individual caught within it. All views can reveal truth none are THE truth.

John–
The point of allowing for a period rest in order to create continued motion resonates, though it is very much at odds with how we (attempt to) work in this world.  This makes sense to me, even if it grates against my impatience 😉 That part of me will just have to get used to reality, it appears.
This whole course of study is incredibly helpful.  Again, thank you for this.

Sidney, delighted to hear it! I’ve already made arrangements to turn this series of commentaries into a book, so you’ll have ample chance for a second pass later on. 😉
Prizm, in Fortune’s terminology, some tracks in space are very deeply rutted indeed. With regard to the Great Conversation, that’s a standard part of every culture; ours focuses on different themes, but if you look at East Asian cultures, say, you’ll find a parallel conversation unfolding over the centuries. As for what beings with greater perspective would think about it all, why, you’ll probably have to ask one.
ShiZen, that’s an excellent theme for a month or so of daily meditations!
Barefootwisdom, thanks for this; I used that as a link in the text early on. 
Zebby, good. By and large, once you’ve learned how to avoid a trap, the skills you develop doing so can be applied in many other contexts…
David, did you ever push a kid on a swing? You shove, then get out of the way, then shove again once the swing’s motion has peaked and it’s starting to go the other way. The logic is much the same here, and no question, it works better than trying to push continuously the same way.

“Apply this same pattern to everyday life, to magical training and practice, or to the cycles of history, and you will find that it makes sense of phenomena that the ordinary linear thinking of our culture leaves unexplained. There is always the period of change in which fresh combinations, permutations, and rhythms of action and reaction unfold, and there is always the subsequent period of rest in which the new forces find their equilibrium and settle into a relative stillness. If you want to make change in any context, you need to allow for intervals of calm between bursts of change.”
Hmm. This sounds exactly like what I did with my temporary break from the Dolmen Arches Course. Taking time to process what had come up and then diving back into it seemed like a good idea at the time (even if the break was much shorter than I thought it would end up being). It’s nice to know someone else thinks so too, given that the usual pattern people seek is constant progress.
I’ve sometimes thought that that, more than anything, is what’s keeping so many people I know from achieving anything with their lives….

Wait a second: are the ten sided atoms expressions of the ten Sephiroth? If so, their journey around the Zodiac can be the evolution of souls through the twelve signs, right?

Anonymous, you may well be right. The ability to take time off when it’s needed, to refocus on something else for a while, to shift to a different tack from time to time — those are essential to a healthy life as well as to any sort of success in the world, and yet our culture’s conventional wisdom blinds people to that. 
Juan Pablo, excellent! Yes, indeed. Keep your eyes wide; there’s a lot of stealth Cabala in this text.

JMG,
Please help me see if I am following this. Suppose a person is like a prime (?), traveling atom desiring to travel all twelve rays, who is skilled (if not a master) in woodwoking, building, gardening, wild edible and medicinal plant gathering, fermenting, singing, dancing, writing….
Yet was once described by a former best friend who was and remains a COO of a Fortune 500 corporation, as a “loser, worthless piece of ****, waste of a life”, and who sometimes feels working poor stuck in this circle, sometimes devolving into self loathing with such words ringing within and emanating out of his mouth toward himself in times of stress….
Maybe that person might need to focus on his evolution by meditation, to master the chaos to become more the master of what he knows, to continue to travel….

The image of the atoms moving along the rays to the Central Sun and resting there for a while reminds me of the idea that there is a time of disembodies rest between incarnations.Regarding the post of Anonymous, I have in my own life found that is a good idea not to do the same thing the whole time, so that my life can be more balanced. That was a while before this post.

John–
The image of pushing a child on a swing (or “pumping” when on a swing oneself) makes an immense amount of sense.
Not to open a particular political issue, but with respect to political/social movements generally: is the tendency of people in these movements to constantly push-push-push one of the reasons so many of those efforts fail to produce the results they desire?  (In addition to any number of other reasons, of course.)







 Kay Robison says: 



								October 11, 2018 at 9:15 am							




Spiritual evolution is what came to my mind when I read this section also Platonic solids.  Do the atoms of different shapes match up with each other to form the really complex ones?  I could see that that would make some really fantastic shapes and complexities.  Also do they pick up more atoms as they progress along each of the rays and through each of the circles?  I didn’t see that what was written would prohibit that, but it is hard reading.







 Dan Mullen says:

A few insights about the previous chapters: It seems the concepts of vortices and paths may be used to understand the different methods of dealing with evil from Chapter 2. The statement “when you resist evil you lock up good” can be understood as the crossing of two tangential forces that sets up a stable vortex. The vortex then becomes a primal atom that becomes a stable part of the Cosmos. We thus “lock up good” and “create something new.” However, if we resist evil with evil, we have two parallel forces, which instead of forming a vortex, will follow the same path out to the Ring-Pass-Not where they will dissipate and resolve into their own elements. So when the Great One said “Resist not evil” and “evil is the scavenger of the Gods,” one meaning is when evil is left alone, it creates a path that other evils will follow by attraction to the edge of the Ring-Cosmos and their influences will be lost. 
One other point is that the concept of good locking up evil to create something new, a primal atom, is one way of understanding why everything in existence is dual in nature.

A lot of this is making me think of astrology, or rather re-think about astrology.  If atoms are collections of motions that are stable in themselves, but have a larger path through space, that seems a lot like a house.  Before this I thought of a house like a bucket that holds a quality about a person, but this is making me think of it like a snap shot of a path of motion.  The rays seem a lot like Sun signs, especially considering they pass through Fortune’s central Sun.  So, you have these spinning bundles of directions and forces passing through a ray and when they get to the furthest expression of the ray and can go no further they are sent along a related but different ray; that seems a lot like the progression of the signs, like the forces of Cancer have elements of personal service towards community, progressing to Virgo as a desire to perfect the personal expression, progressing to Libra to balance the personal and community expressions.
I was also thinking about how the stability achieved by the big atoms in the central sun mirrors the equilibrium of the ring-cosmos and ring-chaos.

As I was trying to focus on the first two paragraphs this morning, my thumb seemed to surrounded by light, which was over a paragraph.  I decided to read that paragraph, which happened to be the paragraph with the “centifrugal” typo.  As I read it, I thought about how you mentioned there were some ideas that were seemingly at odds with one another.  So this morning I’ve been thinking about reconciliation.  The Bible also has lots of ideas which seem to be at odds with one another.  A god of love, yet I recall how he punished a child for jeering at a prophet allowing a bear to maul the child.  How does one reconcile those contradictions?  And perhaps that is one of the points.  There are many things in life which are seemingly at odds with one another but we must constantly challenge ourselves.  And why not?  Things are consistently, stably changing.







 Steve T says: 



								October 11, 2018 at 2:31 pm							




A couple of initial thoughts–
“Fortunately we can sidestep the whole issue by remembering that these are metaphors, and that they can both be good metaphors for a truth that, like all spiritual truths, cannot be grasped by the human mind by any means except metaphor. Here’s one metaphor; here’s another; imagine them both as clearly as possible, think about them, see what sense they make, and then try to get as much of a sense as you can of the structure of consciousness that both metaphors represent.”
I’ve lately felt the need to rely on the divine guidance and protection pretty constantly. The thing is, at various times throughout the day it makes sense to call upon the gods of the Druid revival, especially as you present them in the Celtic Golden Dawn, and especially the four elemental gods and the trinity of Hu, Ced and Hesus– and at other times in the same day it makes sense to call upon the trinity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, to pray to the Blessed Virgin. Both feel right, under the right circumstances. Yesterday I was in the woods, in a deep and dark place that felt very strongly like the energies of Cernunnos and Ceridwen, and I called upon them while walking through that place, asking their blessing and protection. Later I was at home, doing the dishes and feeling difficult emotions, and it felt perfectly natural to pray the Our Father, 3 Hail Marys and Glory Be as part of a prayer to be released from them. Druids, being Druids, will probably understand how this can be better than other pagans, but it’s easy to see both pagans and sacramental Christians being offended by this. And yet it makes perfect sense if, like you say, all these names are metaphors for truths that, like all spiritual truths, cannot be grasped by the human mind.
“If you want to make change in any context, you need to allow for intervals of calm between bursts of change.
Lacking those, instead of a rhythm of change and repose, you can count on setting up a rhythm of change and counter-change, in which the imbalances set in motion by too prolonged a movement to one extreme generate an equally prolonged and unbalanced movement to the other extreme—a pendulum motion going nowhere.”
Of course the first thing I thought of was American politics. Among other examples…
In the late 80s and early 90s there was a major push for Political Correctness on the American Left. This led to a counter-movement against political correctness by the Right, which culminated first in an anti-PC that was as bad as PC (“Oh, sorry for not being POLITICALLY CORRECT” became a way of justifying bad behavior) and then the stifling “patriotic correctness” of the Bush years, in which to criticize the president in any way was to demonstrate that you just Hate America. And love terrorism. And probably are an anti-semite, too, since American and Israeli neo-con foreign policy went hand-in-hand. And of course the reaction to this was today’s stifling and toxic Social Justice movement, which seems to me to be significantly worse than the earlier wave of PC– though, granted, I was a child at that time. I’ve been expecting for some time now that the backlash against this will be a right-wing regime of speech policing that is significantly worse than that which we endured during the Bush years…. and on it goes, with no end in sight.
Immigration is a similar issue. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that a period of high immigration should be proceeded by a period of little or even zero immigration, in order to allow the cultural and social systems of American life to stabilize themselves. This period could be followed by another period of heavy immigration. In fact, we have this, but not in a deliberate way, so that both immigration and anti-immigration periods take the form of backlashes, which include high levels of hostility toward both either immigrants or the native population. It’s hard to imagine a rational conversation in which– speaking just on a cultural, and not an economic level– the yang of immigration and the changes it brings and the yin of stability achieved by closed borders and assimilation were balanced against one another, as yin and yang must be in a healthy system of any kind. It’s hard to imagine, but it would be nice if we could have it, in good faith and with the use of in-door voices by all.
Finally:
“The Ring-Cosmos, like the Father, comes into being out of nothing—“made of none” is quite an expressive way of putting it; the Ring-Chaos, like the Son, is begotten by the motion of the Ring-Cosmos; and the Ring-Pass-Not proceeds from the interaction of the two other Rings as, in Western Christianity, the Holy Ghost proceeds from the other two members of the Trinity.”
It’s interesting to think of how this teaching would be modified by the Eastern Christian teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone… but I don’t have the understanding either of the Eastern Tradition nor of The Cosmic Doctrine to work through that thought. I wonder if anyone else here does?

I started reading the Mystical Qabalah, to try to understand the 7 circles. I’ve only read a few chapters. It’s very interesting, and tons of overlap with the Cosmic Doctrine! I especially like the concept of “overflowing” to explain evolution.
My guess on “why 7 circles?” is now 10 minus 3. The first three Sephiroth are represented by the 3 rings, and the 7 planes represent the remaining 7 Sephiroth. 
One of my favorite video games as a teen, Final Fantasy 7, had a song called Sephiroth, where a choir is chanting his name. Now I can’t get that out of my head. 🙂







 Helen says: 



								October 11, 2018 at 7:33 pm							




Thank you for this discussion, JMG and all.  An association that came strongly to mind for me, is Stephen Jay Gould’s theory of “punctuated equilibrium” in the evolution of life forms. The atoms which have completed their evolution, resting in the central stillness, are using only as much energy as is needed for them to “be” until change is induced by what Fortune terms a “night of manifestation” – the swinging of the Ring-Chaos.  Likewise, life forms are not led to evolve, in the biological sense, unless there is the thrust block of a change – such as climate change or natural disasters.
I also got quite excited about the resemblances with Giordano Bruno’s memory wheels and systems.  I took several months recently to read through Frances Yates’ book (the Art of Memory) alongside your translation of Bruno’s Shadows, and for me these images of Fortune’s illuminate what appears to have been Bruno’s endeavour – to subject any and all intellectual ideas to all other possible influences, by passing each idea through astrological or other spheres of influence in turn.  And now I begin to understand why divination is so important!

William, that’s always a good place to start. It’s also worth remembering that being well-adjusted to a sick and dysfunctional system is not a sign of health…
Booklover, I’m pretty sure Fortune intended that analogy. We’ll be seeing more analogies of the same kind as we move from the Cosmos to the individual solar system, and from there to the individual soul.
David, ding! We have a winner. Successful movements for social change set specific, clearly defined goals, achieve them, and then spend a while — sometimes quite a while — making use of whatever right or benefit has come from the change, before setting new goals and pursuing them. First Wave feminists understood this; they focused all their efforts on winning the right to vote, got it, and then paused to develop their own institutions (such as the League of Women Voters) and convince those who disagreed with their cause that giving women the vote wasn’t the end of the world; only a generation later did a new wave of feminism take off, seeking the next round of changes. Unfortunately Second Wave feminists didn’t have anything like as much common sense as their grandmothers, and having won one set of battles, just kept pushing; the result was the inevitable backlash. If they’d paused, consolidated their gains, and let the rest of society get used to the new arrangement, there would have been no backlash, and the next wave would be getting under way right about now. 
Kay, those are excellent questions that the text doesn’t definitively answer. As we’ll see, in the next (fourth) phase of Cosmic evolutions, the traveling atoms head out again from the Central Sun, and this time they do definitely pick up more atoms as they go. 
Dan, excellent! Yes in both cases. 
Truly, I’m quite sure that the similarities to astrology are intended; in Fortune’s time, if you were an occultist, you studied astrology as a matter of course, and it would have been exactly her style to weave astrological themes as well as Cabalistic ones into this set of images for meditation. 
Prizm, a fine, crisp meditation on a core theme of our text. Thank you. 
Steve, Dion Fortune would have understood that as well. She was perfectly capable of invoking Isis in one ritual and Christ in another, understanding both (and many others) as ways that a divine reality ultimately incomprehensible to human beings reaches out to us. 
Radha, good! Students of this material back in Fortune’s time would probably have started out working with The Mystical Qabalah before going onto The Cosmic Doctrine, so you’re following the traditional course of study. 
Helen, thank you for this! It hadn’t occurred to me to connect Fortune’s metaphor with Gould’s theory, but you’re quite right — it’s the same concept in both.

Dear JMG:  There was a glitch the first time I tried to post—if this is redundant, please delete!
	I was struck by some observations Fortune made in the last 2 paragraphs of this chapter, and was hoping you might comment on them:  
She says that when atoms become composite they take on more ‘weight’, which launches them into a plane farther from the Central Sun, and also makes them susceptible to more influences, and because of that, less free to move. 
	My image for understanding that last statement is the way social ties and property make it difficult for a person to relocate geographically. 
	Then, Fortune goes on to say that “it is only when the extremely elaborate atoms of the Seventh Circle form alliances that they start back up the spiral to the Central Sun.” 
	Is she saying that these additional alliances make the atoms too complex to remain in the Seventh Circle, so that they are rebuffed by the Ring Pass Not and sent back?  
	Do these atoms divest themselves of alliances, complexity and weight as they spiral back through the planes inhabited by simpler atoms, or do they retain them all into their next outward journey?  She has said of atoms, that by definition “though composite, when once formed they cannot be resolved, but are permanently units.” Do they perhaps divest themselves of the forms that imposed the complexity, while retaining the internal “geometry” of stresses imposed by their experiences? 
	I had been imagining the human microcosm’s spiraling return to the Center as something that takes place after a climax of development and complexity in full maturity, with the social and physical retrenchments of old age, followed by separation of the various bodies at death, and physical disintegration. 
	Since extremely complex atoms do not “belong” on the inner planes, I imagine that their next journey out from the Center to the 7th plane must happen very quickly. And then, since such complex atoms do not “belong” on the 6th-1st planes, what does that indicate about the spiraling path back in to the Center?  
	Am I reading Dion Fortune correctly here, or am I misunderstanding something? 
	Your commentary on The Cosmic Doctrine, along with the reader commentary, is hugely valuable!

Picturing the atoms radiating outwards from the Central Sun got me thinking of how radar operates.  Atoms are transmitted outwards like the electromagnetic waves of radar.  They can be reflected off of what they encounter and then return to the transmitter, relaying information about the surrounding area.
If that’s the case, then atoms are like the sensory organs of the Cosmos or Central Sun.  They are how it gathers information and learns about itself.  
If we were to think of the atoms as the various created beings, then they (and we) are the conscious sensory apparatus of the Cosmos.  We gather information through being alive and experiencing all the forces present in the Cosmos, responding to the various stimuli, and returning to find balance in the center. 
At least, that’s what showed up in meditation!

The importance of alternating patterns of activity and rest came up tonight in the book I’m reading, “Hare Brain, Tortise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Less,” by Guy Claxton. I know, but once you get past the rather unpromising title, the author puts together a nice analysis (or perhaps reflection?) on two different types of thinking, which he calls d-mode (logical, rational problem solving) and intuition. He quotes Nobel prize winner Karl Lorenz: “This apparatus…which intuits, plays in a very mysterious manner, because it keeps all known facts afloat, waiting for them to fall into place, like a jigsaw puzzle. And if you try to press, if you try to permutate your knowledge, nothing comes of it. You must give it a sort of mysterious pressure, and then a rest, and suddenly, BING, the solution comes.”  And George Spencer Brown, on Newton’s approach: “To arrive at the simplest truth, as Newton knew and practiced, requires years of contemplation. Not activity. Not reasoning. Not calculating. Not busy behavior of any kind. Not reading. Not talking. Not making an effort. Not thinking. Simply _bearing in mind_ what it is that one needs to know.”  Contrast that with the constant meaningless bustling and nattering that is the hallmark of our modern society, and suddenly the utter stupidity and vapidity of so much of public discourse and action makes sense, in fact seems inevitable. The pace of modern life we hear so much about includes no time for contemplation, inactivity, rumination, and our increased efforts to reason our way out only make things worse. Perhaps we need to choose the right things to bear in mind, ‘give it a sort of mysterious pressure’, and then wait quietly to see what settles out. Hmm, sounds kind of familiar…

“When…. they form alliances and become composite, their weight, that is to say, their susceptibility to influences, is increased and susceptibility to influences is all that weight is esoterically. That fact forms the basis of limitation and flight through space.  Cut off your susceptibility to influence and you can move freely.”
This may also be a trap, but it seems that DF is offering us here a way of suspending or sidestepping “limitation”.  All it takes is cutting off susceptibility to influence.  Given that the “weighty” atom is already a composite of many atoms, each of which have experienced innumerable forces (or influences?) both before coming together, and together as a unit, each of which remains a track in space forever, this does seem to be the same as requiring the atom (or ourselves as metaphorical composite atoms) to cut itself off from it’s history.  This sounds almost Faustian – both the temptation of moving freely, flying through space without limitation, and the inbuilt requirement to cut oneself off from one’s history (accrued influences) and relationships (current influences).  
Much to meditate on here.  
Also, how lovely a phrase is “sphere of swirl”?  🙂

JMG –
At a certain point in reading through your discussion, my mind automatically shifted from visualizing the movement of the atoms along the rays to picturing the movement of the Yang-style Taijiquan long form. Almost immediately thereafter I felt my qi beginning to follow the visualization, spiraling out from the lower dantian toward the extremities and then back again.   
The movements of Taijiquan are continuous spirals with no breaks or pauses, which is why it is so important to come to rest at the end of the form and allow the qi to settle back fully into the lower dantian. This is as much part of the form as the motion itself; you can cause problems if you set your qi in motion strongly and then don’t allow it to return to rest.
This also reminds me of the Daoist philosophy behind the foundational posture of Xing Yi: the San Ti stance. In the style of Xing Yi that I studied, you begin in the Wuji posture, representing the undifferentiated infinite. This moves next through the Taiji posture, which represents the unity (or “one thing”) that emerges from the Wuji and that brings forth the Yin and Yang (the “two things”). Finally, the body opens with the feet and hands moving apart into the San Ti posture, representing the bringing forth of the third essential from which an infinite set of possibilities can emerge.
This pattern reflects the Daoist saying that the Dao produces the One, One generates Two, Two generates Three, and Three generates all the things in the world.
It’s always interesting to meditate on how these exact themes appear almost identically in both eastern and western esoteric thought…

KKA, good. To take your metaphor of social ties and possessions a little further, imagine someone in a Midwestern town who becomes a celebrity — let’s say she writes a book that becomes a bestseller. As that happens, though she retains her existing friendships and possessions, she moves out into a wider world — interacting with news media, reviewers, other authors, and the literary public — which brings changes and experiences she wouldn’t have had if she’d just kept on working as a librarian in South Bend, Indiana. 
The atoms that begin the journey through the twelve rays are highly complex, and they become almost unimaginably more so in the course of their passage through the rays. As we’ll see next month, when they leave the Central Sun in the next phase of Cosmic evolution, a different principle determines where they settle out. 
Uxurious, a solid guess. Figuring out how that sort of correspondence works is the kind of exercise Fortune liked to leave to her students. I’ll look forward to seeing how you work it all out. 😉
Stefania, I like that metaphor! 
Heather, exactly. Exactly. That’s why discursive meditation is so powerful a tool for thinking; it helps the practitioner get past the chatter and start accessing the mind’s deeper potentials. 
Scotlyn, good. Very good. That’s the underlying logic behind Fortune’s comments about evil in a previous chapter. If you oppose something you become susceptible to its influence, and limit your freedom of action — which is something worth doing in some situations, but it’s not the only game in town. You can also let it mosey on past on its way to the Ring-Pass-Not, and remain uninfluenced by it. 
Ailin, an excellent point. The circles and spirals that define the Cosmos in The Cosmic Doctrine make it a particularly good fit to Taijiquan — I’m thinking here among other things of Step Forward and Punch as I was taught it, where the fist moves out in an apparently more or less straight line (actually a subtle spiral, of course), and then draws back in a more obviously curved pattern involving the other hand. As for your broader point, which is also good, I tend to think that the reason the basic teachings of Taoism and Western occultism are so similar is that they’re talking about the same spiritual and philosophical realities — the differences between the traditions are partly a matter of emphasis, and partly a matter of the very different modes of practice.

The statement “The Central Sun is that point in space which would be reached if a line from the sun of your system were drawn to the star known as ‘Alpha Centauri’ and thence projected.” is interesting because it is written as if stated by someone who lives outside our solar system. The term Central Sun is also written as a proper noun where the sun of out solar system is not. Our sun and solar system to this greater intelligence may just be a complex atom traversing and evolving in the ring/plane system of a greater Primal Trinity. A nice thought to keep one humble, and thanks to this greater intelligence for watching over and guiding us.

I’m struck by the difference between atoms (which Fortune finally allows us to call ‘matter’) and forces. Both are ultimately the same thing- just movement in space- yet scale and structure give them very different characteristics.
Ever since reading your book ‘A World Full of Gods’ I’ve been playing in my head with ideas of monotheism, classical polytheism as you describe it, and Hindu polytheism, which seems to combine both. If God is the Unmanifest, then all deities and beings in the Cosmos are ultimately of the same origin and substance, only manifesting at different levels of complexity. My question for the last little while has been, on what level does it make sense to speak of discrete gods and goddesses with individual motivations and wills, and on what level doesn’t it?
Now I’m asking myself a different question. Are deities more like atoms or more like forces? The Rays and Circles are more or less discrete entities, but less so than the atoms. What I think I’m describing is a middle perspective between classical monotheism and classical polytheism.

Yes, it is interesting that the Orthodox Church actually broke with the Roman in part over the issue of the wording in the creed, which in the original Nicene creed from about 360 or 380 or so, states that the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Actually, that is biblical. Jesus stated it that way in the gospel. The Orthodox church says that the Roman way is not only an illegitimate change, but that it diminishes the person of the Holy Spirit. I have tended to agree with this as the Holy Spirit in western churches tends to be tacked on here or there as almost an afterthought, whereas in the Orthodox Church they are meticulously even handed regarding the Trinity. The Orthodox Church also says that the Holy Spirit is the uncreated energies of God.
They also say that the wording of this ‘proceeding from the Father and the Son’ in the creed was a later error that got out of hand and couldn’t be corrected. But I did not know about this Athanasian creed, and it actually slightly predates the Nicene council, so obviously there has been these two ways of interpreting it for a long time. 
It’s not always easy to draw parallels with the various trinities and cosmic beliefs that use the number 3. Certainly with the three rings, it works very well with this Athanasian creed.
My own interpretation of the Christian Trinity is that God the Father is of course the missing feminine element, and is God the Mother. Mother, Son and Spirit. She is the mother because  she is the void of pure potential, the dark and unknown abyss from which universes manifest. The Source. Obviously to birth a cosmos is feminine. The Word (son) is the mind of God and what I call the organizing force. To be sure, without this Word, nothing that was made could be made – because it creates structure! How it’s born I am not sure but what I see is a union between chaos, the unmanifest, the void – and the incredible way that life and the universe is filled with order and rays and spheres and cycles and DNA and cell membranes, and, and, and….I find it very masculine, it’s all about structure.
Well the Holy Spirit is God’s spirit, the nonlocal, the ether, the plasma, the life force. The unity in motion, the unmanifest moving through the manifest, the bridge.
An analogy I have heard is the sun – the body of the sun equates to the Father (really the Mother) and the heat of the sun is the Son, and the light is the Spirit. You see they are all one and they all arise from one another and you can’t have any in isolation yet none are identical either. But the body of the sun is yet the source of the other two.

First of all, thank you for bringing The Cosmic Doctrine down to Earth for me and others.  I am confident I would have been up a creek without a paddle without this series of posts and their commentaries.  The study of this book in particular has made a thousand more occult books that were misunderstood by me seem well within reach given time and discursive meditation.
Going back to metaphors, modern people tend to carry the curse of thinking literally: hence people taking the Bible and Q’uran at face value and fighting wars over semantics, like the scene with the shoe vs. the gourd in the Life of Brian.  In my college years, my friend and I went to see a film called Prêt-à-Porter about the fashion industry.  She kept waiting through the movie for Prêt-à-Porter to show up as the starring role, not realizing it is the French term “ready to wear”.  I’d make fun of her if I hadn’t been similarly naive during many occasions in my life, with no end in sight.
The first image that came to mind when Fortune described the atoms and their sides was rain drops on a windowpane and how some slip downward fast, join others, and drip off in pools as others seem to stay put.  Like the other readers, there are lots of images flooding in and making sense where before, obscure books like this seemed hopeless.  Thanks in advance for a lifetime of gifts, JMG.

JMG–re Second Wave Feminism–part of the problem is that the push of the feminists for greater access to financial control, good jobs, education and careers overlapped with the point in the economic cycle at which resource depletion was starting to kick in, the 1970s. The result was that while some women were fighting for prestigious careers a larger number of women were being pushed into the workplace as two jobs became necessary to support a family. This led to resentment and backlash from both the men who felt unmanned by no longer being able to do the male job of supporting a family and from the women who did find housekeeping, childcare and so forth a worthy use of their time. And in reality women got stuck doing both jobs without family leave, child care and societal support that some other nations offer. Getting the vote was a clear and easily defined goal. The goals of second wave feminism were less easy to define, and a lot less easy to achieve, and arguably have not been achieved..So how would the movement have known when to stop?

Thinking about the journey of the atoms along a Ray out to the Ring-Pass-Not, then bouncing off and coming back to the centre, to travel out again past the same circles but on a different Ray – ‘feeling [the Ring-Pass-Not’s] force from all angles’. It seems a lot like a person’s journey through life – we experience similar circumstances repeatedly, but due to our previous journeying we’re not the same person as last time, and each encounter changes us again for the next repeat. Scale it up past a single lifetime and now it’s a metaphor for reincarnation.
Thank you for this series; I know I wouldn’t have gotten this far without a guide. It’s a very, very big metaphor.

Hi John Michael,
As a fellow of the ‘centrifrugal’ way of life, I salute Dion and her foresight for understanding the one true way… 🙂
I’m getting a sense of creation and consumption all in one circular motion with your words, but will have to dwell upon them more. Incidentally, I often feel that it is a deliberate ploy to get people to busy themselves and fixate upon abstract goals rather than peering out, considering and wondering about the world that exists about them. I see that playing out in peoples lives where they have little time for reflection, and I can’t but help think that this is a deliberate construction. But other than a vague sense that it is so, I have no real comparisons to draw other than my own experiences and historical accounts from books. Dunno.
Cheers
Chris

Re: Rita’s post,
The question of when the movement would have known to stop is a very practical one. It is clear to me that there are cycles such that certain times are better for pushing, creating and starting new things, and other times are best for consolidating your gains and building a solid base from which to push farther. At the highest level I assume you look to astrology to read where on the cycle you are at the time. Would the point on the cycle translate down through all the microcosms? Could a microcosm’s own cycle be out of phase with the higher cycles?
More important to me, if you can’t yet make sense of astrology is there another way to see when to stop pushing? 
In the example of feminism, I’m sure that getting the vote was a clearly defined goal, but also sure that the women driving the movement had further goals-such as electing women to office-but stopped pushing in order to consolidate their gains first. In the second wave, after being accepted into the workplace the inequality of treatment would have been painfully obvious, and so the temptation to keep pushing would be irresistable. 
Also want to second Tude’s sentiment: thanks to all of you for the conversation. As someone just beginning practice (CGD) with no previous occult knowledge, the Cosmic Doctrine is a bit too abstract for me at this point, but I’m learning a lot from listening in.

Regarding the concept of periods of change and instability, followed by periods of equilibrium, this reminds me of Gramsci’s idea of the Interregnum.  Gramsci saw this period of instability in a generally negative way, with its “morbid symptoms”, which, watching politics unfold in the UK at the moment, seem to consist of the devotees of the old order losing their minds, and their new challengers often reaching back to atavistic ideas.

								October 13, 2018 at 4:31 pm							




Scotlyn, JMG
I was also considering the paragraph that mentions ‘susceptibility to influences is all that weight is esoterically…cut off your susceptibility to influence and you can move freely.’
So…we have atoms streaming outwards from the central sun.  At this stage, they are very simple and light as they are not yet under the influence of very many forces.  They could be thought of as energy, vibrating at a very high rate, existing only on the spiritual plane or on the innermost circles closest to the Central Sun.  As they journey outwards they gradually begin to slow down as they are acted on by the various forces.  They get heavier and heavier as they go, and undergo a change of state from energy to gas to liquid and finally to solid, the heaviest state of matter.  At this point they are under the influence of a large number of forces and their vibrational rate has slowed considerably.  So, as the atoms gain complexity they gain more weight, which is another way of saying they become susceptible to more forces acting on them. 
From an esoteric point of view, the evolution of the individual, or the return path of the atom would involve somehow gradually starting to lose this weight, or somehow cutting oneself off from the forces.  Although that is a bit hard to conceive of considering the forces ‘form the framework of the universe,’ at the very least we could hope to be fully conscious of the forces instead of unconsciously being under their influence.  
As a simple example, let’s say my society with its materialistic focus on progress tells me I must be a successful career person, drive a fancy car and live in a McMansion etc.  Once I (hopefully) begin to evolve esoterically, I will no longer blindly be led about by this influence or force of society.  The force is still there, as other people around me are influenced by it and fall into its track in space, but it ceases to compel me or guide my actions and decisions. I could now decide to do what I really want instead of just unconsciously following along with what society tells me to do and taking the path of least resistance.
So it would seem that the esoteric work of an individual’s evolution is going to involve somehow creating resistance to the effects of the forces.  It’s going to involve some kind of work or effort to get out of the tracks in space, to get free from the influence of the various forces.  If this book does actually turn out to be about occult philosophy and not physics or chemistry, then I’m hopeful that Dion will give us some instruction as to how we might go about doing these things.

Yes, this is an amazing ride. The first time I read Cos.Doc, I knew it was really something. Now, reading and rereading, after rereading again, and with your insights, I’m beginning to think I might be able to get my fingertips onto it. I noticed long ago that the master’s touch was light, and that every time I picked up something new I tended to over do and over correct. Since working with the circuit of force involves working with opposites and their influences, it would be nice to spend less time in the wildly overreaching and over-correcting phases. Your comment “instead of a rhythm of change and repose, you can count on setting up a rhythm of change and counter-change, in which the imbalances set in motion by too prolonged a movement to one extreme generate an equally prolonged and unbalanced movement to the other extreme” and the structural understanding Cos.Doc is describing are very helpful. It seems that an action in a specific direction should be careful, and a lag time should be expected, before gauging the amount of impact. It seems so simple, like adding salt to soup. I’m looking forward to when you release your related book. This is so fascinating!







 Ron M says: 



								October 14, 2018 at 8:22 pm							




I found this section of CosDoc to be truly fascinating. The point about change followed by stasis is a phenomenon that surrounds us in nature in terms of the course of the day (dawn and dusk being the transitions and day and night being stasis) and the year (spring and autumn being the seasons of change and summer and winter the seasons of stasis). Why modern Western society cannot fathom the wisdom of this approach is totally beyond me.
On the social front, I note that Mahatma Gandhi had only a few big campaigns in his Indian independence struggle. He waited enormous amounts of time (for example, 1919 to 1930) while other freedom fighters impatiently gnashed their teeth eager for the next battle with the British Raj. But Gandhiji wouldn’t budge: he waited until the gains of the previous campaign had reached full fruition before determining the next move.

Successful movements for social change set specific, clearly defined goals, achieve them, and then spend a while — sometimes quite a while — making use of whatever right or benefit has come from the change, before setting new goals and pursuing them.
This is something I’ve thought of before: if giving in to someone means they’re going to demand even more from you, at some point you’re going to stop giving in, even when the request is otherwise reasonable. I suspect that’s part of why the movement for trans equality was so easy to derail: coming on the heels of the victory for same-sex marriage, it often felt—and I say this as a supporter!—like there wasn’t even supposed to be a discussion; everyone just has to accept this now. This despite Republicans’ best attempts to make it relevant and attractive to cisgender people by pushing absurd bathroom laws.
This is also part of another problem in our society, that the concepts of rights and responsibilities have been effectively decoupled. When the two go together, and an increase in one comes with an increase in the other, you can have an effective motivational structure. When they’re decoupled, you get some profoundly perverse incentives and institutions.

Thank you for your insight re the seasons and the CosDoc model! Living in Australia I have for many years, off and on, been trying to come to some ecologically and spiritually appropriate mental model of our local seasons. Maybe it wouldn’t seem obvious to others, but in trying to decide which religious/spiritual/occult traditions and rituals might work for me in my area this seems to matter a lot! 
We are in a frosty temperate area with a very hot dry summers so the inherited Northern European/English model of Spring/rebirth-Summer/ripening-Autumn/maturity-Winter/death and associated spiritual imagery doesn’t really fit. If you try and shoehorn it in we very much have two ‘mild death’ periods – Summer and Winter and two ‘less intense rebirth’ periods – Spring and Autumn. Which seems … awkward. Middle Eastern sourced religions (themes of progression towards death as heat) and Scandinavian spiritual traditions (themes of progression towards death as extreme cold and snow) also haven’t felt quite right to me here.
Even more complicated if you consider trying to accommodate the local indigenous model as, although not much has been published, it seems likely to have had six or eight seasons of wildly different lengths which related to a progression in the pulses of availability of certain food stuffs (eg the short but intense ‘season’ for eating lots of migrating Bogong Moths and getting fat before the coldest period).
However, I can definitely see a locally appropriate seasonal model alternating stasis and change instead, along the lines of: Spring/solar energy ramp up – Early Summer/burst of change – Mid Summer until Autumn rains/consolidation and bunkering down – Autumn rainy period/water energy ramp up – Late Autumn/burst of change – Winter/consolidation and bunkering down. This corresponds well with major climatic influences and peaks and droughts of local foods and has a lot of interesting implications spiritual and otherwise.

Reading the previous chapter of this book changed my consciousness somehow. Trying to assign meaning to what changed later I’d say it got me out of my ‘thinking mind’ or an excessive identification with it.
I had an unusual ‘dream’ that night where I was partly awake and partly dreaming. I was vibrating at a different level, there was a kind of shimmering sound, and there was a sense of an external presence. At times felt frightened — why I would feel frightened I can’t understand, as it was so beautiful. It kind of reminded me of how I felt when a Lakota-trained person did a shamanic healing on me and I felt connected & balanced like I never had before, and felt a vibration. In another part of this ‘dream’ a woman walked toward me and handing me something — a book I think.
I’m amazed how writing can do this. Having worked with music a lot I can easily pick out patterns in writing — there is always a rhythm unique to each individual, but can change some according to moods — but this is something different. Perhaps she is very deliberately laying down a track, or perhaps in an unusual state of consciousness when writing it.
Anyway, I look forward to reading this chapter too, but I’m a little frightened so I keep putting it off.

While thinking about the complex atoms making their circuit through the rays, what sticks out to me most is that the atoms go out along the rays in a straight line, and then begin to receive influence from the seven circles only on the way back. This would imply to me that the atoms are receiving the most complex influences first, and then the influences become progressively less complex as they approach the Central Sun again. I’m still contemplating what this could mean, but it seemed significant to me.

Hi JMG,
I found I actually needed to take this book in slower than you are doing it with us even.  At least in the way I’d been trying to do it, so now I have read up to chapter 4 and I’ll keep reading your guides and stay up to your point in the book, but I will not worry about all the close readings right now and do them with time.  It’s just too much to take in and try to work through all at once.  I think this is maybe like you are talking about though, giving my thinking the time to catch up to these ideas.
I mentioned this before to you but I’ve found these ideas incredibly widely applicable, almost like an invisible basket that everything else I think about or have thought about before has a spot in. So with each bit more these concepts invade my thinking and start ordering it.  It’s a good thing!  It’s been very useful already, but I couldn’t keep up the pace I was doing and it felt more right to go slower with it.
I had some questions though, earlier (I think in chapter 2) she made a statement to the effect of, “creatures of a Cosmos cannot leave the Ring-Pass-Not, even in thought,”  I found this rather provocative and after a lot of thought I wondered if she is not getting at something else here than it first seems.  Her comment in this chapter about how new Cosmoi spring from existing ones, and that all things follow this same set of rules seems to relate it.   Is she saying that when we think of something outside our Cosmos we effectively leave it?
I’ll use the example of music genres (something I thought this fit well with).  I am less of a fan these days, but I used to be fairly involved in different heavy metal scenes, and the genres within it do seem to function this way.  A band or two will sometimes do something new that isn’t normally allowed within the limits of (suppose all the bands are interpreting “heavy” as something fast, but then a few start to go slow) you’ll see eventually a new Cosmos created that bands spin around.  Once the genres are formalized then each has it’s rules and limits and future genres get created from within them.  So what was one thing becomes multiple, contained within the larger genres.  Each time these limits are more restrictive but they give rise to genuinely new forms that can be very dynamic – they get more out of less.
Thanks,
Johnny

Hi JMG,
The atoms can be understood as a smaller Cosmoi – is that correct?  They have motion and it follows that the same laws apply where they create their own Rings.  I know Fortune made a comment about this relationship being applicable at any scale.  I think that is what she means.
It seems that if that is true, many seemingly unrelated (and even opposing forces) are created by the motion of a larger cosmos that underlies them (and drives their movement).  If you can discover it, and align yourself with this greater cycle, you can take advantage of the momentum of this far more powerful source.
A person can align their cosmos by looking at what they consider good, by definition it is the same as the movement of Cosmos they are in. If they can consider something else good then this act is changing their alignment.
Also I think that if the cosmos goes in cycles your thoughts must also go in cycles (as individuals and as groups).
The last thing I wanted to mention was that it occurred to me that the motion of thoughts and the motion of an object in space are not the same.  At first I thought that thoughts must have no motion at all, because I was thinking about how you can contemplate things without making any steps towards realizing them, and how really this is empty, and “unmanifest” much like space.  But then I thought that thoughts are still more manifest than things I haven’t ever thought at all.  So it must be like the scale issue, where they follow the same laws relative to their own nature, maybe on different planes of existence.  Physical manifestation of change requires actual physical movement though.
I want to have fewer Cosmoi that I am aligned to by seeing the greater cycles and seeing how they are good.  I want to physically echo that movement, both in ritual and in execution because this is movement in the direction that will increase that good.  This is because my action makes the thoughts realized and because it can stir another to action.
I am still struggling to conceive of the geometry of the Rays and Circles, and of the movement of the atoms, but these were some messy thoughts that came to me as a result of turning these ideas over in my head within the structure she’s laid out
If I’m up the wrong tree here it’s cool – I’ve found all this stuff quite a bit more interactive and useful than philosophy often is (and I like philosophy!)
Thanks,
Johnny

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Beginnings of a Solar System 
November 14, 2018John Michael Greer89 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 6, “The Beginnings of a Solar System,” pp. 31-34.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 5, “The Genesis of a Solar System,” from the second complete paragraph on p. 43 (which starts with the words “You have heard how these atoms…”) to the end of the chapter.
Commentary:
As with previous chapters it’s probably wise to revisit two points before going on.  First, it’s essential to keep in mind the basic rule Fortune puts at the beginning of the text—“These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are intended to train the mind, not to inform it.”  Second, this is a textbook of occult philosophy, not of astrophysics. When Fortune discusses solar systems in this chapter, she’s using concepts borrowed from astronomy as a set of metaphors, not trying to compete with the astronomers of her time (or ours) by offering up a physical theory of the formation of solar systems.
There’s a further level to the metaphor, however, and it’s one that will become increasingly important as the book proceeds. From ancient times onward, it’s been common in Western esoteric writings to identify the sun as the representation, the habitation, or even the material body of the principal divine power active in the world we know. That habit almost certainly has Egyptian roots, tracing its origins to the veneration of the sun god Ra; you can find the same solar vision all the way through classical Western occultism from the emperor Julian’s hymns to Helios the sun god straight through to Robert Fludd’s identification of the sun as the habitation of the Logos, the second person of the Christian trinity.
Fortune’s work is squarely in this tradition. For her, the Solar Logos—whom she also identifies as the second person of the Christian trinity, by the way—is the god of this solar system, the Great Organism who organizes and conditions everything on Earth and the other planets that orbit our sun. In the chapters we’ve already studied, Fortune has sketched out in metaphoric terms the evolutionary process by which the Solar Logos (and countless other Great Organisms of the same type) comes into being; we now proceed to the chapters in which she explores how the Solar Logos creates a solar system in the image of the greater Cosmos.
That process begins as the traveling atoms discussed in last month’s commentary find their way back to the Central Sun. Each traveling atom has gone out and back again along each of the twelve Rays, absorbing the influences of each Ray on each of the seven Circles or Cosmic planes of existence. Each of these atoms started out as a vortex of movement in space based on a simple geometrical pattern; each finishes its journey as a fantastically complex structure of forces in equilibrium, having experienced every possibility the cosmos has to offer and made each one of those possibilities part of its internal structure.
These Great Organisms, as we may now call them, started their outward journey when the Ring-Cosmos was turning toward the Ring-Chaos. As they complete the journey, they come to rest in the Central Sun and stay there as the Ring-Cosmos begins pivoting away from the Ring-Chaos and the Cosmos sinks into its negative phase. Once the Ring-Cosmos begins moving toward the Ring-Chaos again, the Great Organisms leave the Central Sun again, following the lines of the twelve Rays.
In the previous phase of activity, the atoms moved outwards to fill empty space, and some of them became complex enough to go all the way out to the Ring-Pass-Not and begin the career as a traveling atom that would transform them into Great Organisms. In this new phase of activity, the atoms that didn’t become traveling atoms are still there, distributed by density (or geometrical structure) among the seven Circles. As the Great Organisms go out along the Rays, they gather up as many of the atoms of each plane as their mass can attract, and their outward movement slows down accordingly. Eventually each of the Great Organisms, with its cloud of accompanying atoms, comes to rest in one of the Circles and begins to revolve around the Central Sun at a fixed distance, passing through each of the Rays in turn.
What determines the Circle in which any given Great Organism settles down to stay? Here again, we have the trap mentioned in last month’s commentary, the one Fortune laid with exquisite care for would-be fundamentalists. Remember how an earlier chapter had only the ten-sided atoms becoming traveling atoms, while all the other atoms settled out to stay in one or another of the circles, from the three-sided atoms in the first circle, all the way out to the nine-sided atoms in the seventh. Here, all of a sudden, the Great Organisms can have atoms of any shape at their core, and each one settles out into a circle determined by the number of sides of its basic form. “If the vortex set up in the angles of the Rays moved in a three-sided path, it could go no further than the first plane beyond the Central Stillness,” our text says; “it would have to be a ten-sided figure to reach the seventh plane and evolve there.”
Did you hear that click? That was the trap closing shut.
The difficulty Fortune has placed in the way of a simplistic literalism here is straightforward enough: the numbers don’t work. If atoms based on three-sided figures settle out in the first Circle, atoms based on four-sided figures in the second Circle, those based on five-sided figures in the third Circle, and so on, then the atoms assigned to the seventh Circle would be nine-sided, and ten-sided atoms would have no place to go. Try to turn The Cosmic Doctrine into an allegedly infallible sacred scripture and you crash headlong into that obvious problem. Accept instead that it’s a set of metaphors meant to train the mind, and you’re fine; sure, the numbers don’t work, but they don’t need to.
You can imagine, with perfect serenity, the Great Organism that created our solar system having a ten-sided figure at its core. You can see it drifting out along one of the Rays, gathering a cloud of other atoms with it as it goes, and settling into its permanent orbit on the seventh Circle. Since the rest of the book focuses on events inside our solar system, that’s as much as you need. Since all this is metaphor, getting bent out of shape because every detail doesn’t mesh precisely with every other detail is like responding to Robert Burns’ claim that his love is like a red, red rose by seeing if she has thorns and green skin.
With that in mind, let’s return to the metaphor.  Once each Great Organism settles into its permanent orbit, the cloud of atoms that surrounds it sorts itself out into a miniature Cosmos, with the Great Organism at the center and a disk of less complex atoms around it, reflecting the Central Sun and the disk of the Ring-Cosmos. That’s a newborn solar system, as Fortune comments elsewhere, to the nearest approximate metaphor: the Great Organism as the sun-to-be, and the cloud of atoms surrounding it as the great swirling cloud of cosmic dust and debris that will eventually coalesce into planets, asteroids, and comets.
With this picture sketched out, Fortune proceeds to drop several important hints. The first is that the solar system we happen to inhabit is nothing special. Even the subset of them that settle into orbits on the seventh plane are so numerous that the stars known to human beings are but an infinitesimal fraction of the total, and each of the other Cosmic planes has a comparable number of Great Organisms building solar systems there, outside the reach of our awareness in this phase of our evolution. The point being made here is one that nineteenth- and twentieth-century occultism liked to stress: human beings are not the be-all and end-all of existence, and the cosmos does not exist solely for our benefit.
We have a place in the scheme of things.  As we’ll see in more detail later on, it’s by no means a shabby place, all things considered, but it’s not unique to us, and there are other beings who rank far above us in the scale of things and will always do so. The sort of giddy anthropocentric arrogance that claims vast cosmic importance for human beings, and only for human beings, was already far too common when the nineteenth-century occult revival got under way, and it’s become even more so since then.  Where Renaissance occultists such as Giovanni Pico di Mirandola spoke of the dignity and potential power of humanity, to try to counter the contempt for the human condition so common in the Middle Ages, modern occultists have had to grapple with the opposite problem, and labored to deflate the overblown collective ego of our species.
That’s the first hint. The second one is another of those remarkable prefigurations of systems theory that pop up all through The Cosmic Doctrine. In Dion Fortune’s time, the very first tentative efforts toward systems theory were trying to find a way to describe the way that every system divides itself into subsystems structured like the original system, and these subsystems do the same thing in turn. When I studied systems theory in college in the early 1980s, systems theorists had assigned that property a variety of names, such as self-similarity and recursive structure.
Not long thereafter, though, a branch of mathematics that had begun to explore the same process in numerical and geometrical forms got its fifteen minutes and more of fame, and gave the rest of us a straightforward way to talk about the property in question. Were Dion Fortune to reincarnate now for the purpose of bringing out an enlarged and revised edition of The Cosmic Doctrine, she could sum up half a dozen lengthy paragraphs with a single sentence: the Cosmos is fractal.
In a fractal picture, each part of the image—all the way down to the smallest—duplicates the overall structure of the picture, and vice versa. That same dynamic structures the relationship between the Cosmos, individual solar systems, and individual beings that exist within a solar system. That’s what Fortune is getting at in the last half dozen paragraphs of this chapter. The Cosmos has Rings and Rays and Circles, and so each solar system develops its own rings and rays and circles; within each solar system, in turn, the atoms that got scooped up with the Great Organism who is that system’s Solar Logos go through a reflection of the same experience that made a Solar Logos out of a traveling atom, and themselves become Great Organisms, and the process continues.
The Cosmos is fractal, and so everything we have discussed in terms of the overall structure of the (metaphorical) universe is also part of the structure of each individual human being, and each human society, and each ecosystem, and any other whole system you want to understand. As a human being, a microcosm of the macrocosm, you have your own Ring-Cosmos, Ring-Chaos, and Ring-Pass-Not; you have your own Rays (the cusps of your natal horoscope) and your own Circles (the various bodies, dense and subtle, of the human being); your actions spiral outward from your Central Sun to your Ring-Pass-Not and back again, evolving into habits that find their proper orbit and continue in it thereafter. As above, so below: the great axiom of the Hermetic tradition is a continuing theme of The Cosmic Doctrine, and this is one of the places where it’s central.
Though the Cosmos and the individual have the same basic structure, in turn, there’s a crucial difference between them: the Cosmos forms the environment that conditions and influences the individual, not the other way around. At every moment your consciousness and your life are being shaped by the forces of the cosmos; some of the ways in which this happens are obvious, but a great many more are not. The essence of the Secret Wisdom—that is to say, the essence of occultism, since “occult” simply means “that which is hidden”—is the knowledge of those hidden influences, and of the times and places and forces that cause them to change. To know those influences is to attain wisdom. To wield them in harmony with the innate patterns and directions of the Cosmos is to become the equivalent of a traveling atom: in a phrase traditional among occultists, it is to enter onto the Path.
 
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on December 12. Until then, have at it!

John–
Re the nesting of systems and the directional flow of influence
Understanding the direction of influence is unidirectional from Higher/Outer to Lower/Inner, what of “neighboring” sub-systems at the same level?  Would their influence on one another be bilateral?  (I’d presume so, taking the example of the human being as one “level” of system, as two human beings can certainly influence one another.)
Re the “trap”  
I do suppose it would be too much to ask for Fortune to proceed from definitions, lemma, and theorems… 😉 
I’ve tried framing the text as an exercise manual.  Do this regimen, then this one, then that series of exercises over here.  In that case, yes, a fundamentalist/literalist approach makes no sense (“This is the One True Way of exercise!”).  But exercises have an end goal (getting fit, losing weight, being healthy).  Does she, later in the text, address the end goal of this training? (Whether cloaked in metaphor or not?)  Or are we just to understand that this training produces a “healthier” mind?

Thanks for this very cogent explanation – I could not make heads or tails out of this text without it.  Incidentally, there was a program about Native American history and religion on PBS last night that noted the biggest North and Central American civilizations all considered the sun as the major divinity also.

I think a possible reason 10 was used instead of 9 to describe the base geometry of atoms that reach the Seventh Circle is a hint that these cycles of evolution never end. The number 9 represents the end of a cycle, but add 1 to it to make 10, and we have the beginning of a new cycle, because 10 reduces to 1 by theosophical reduction. When a composite atom reaches the Seventh Circle, a new cycle will eventually start. All is motion, even while in rest.
I also find it interesting that in many traditions, we rest during the seventh period of a cycle: fields are left fallow in their seventh year, God rested on the seventh day of creation, etc. Maybe the idea behind using the number 10 is that the composite atoms do not actually rest in the Seventh Circle as one might think they should as part of a cycle of 7; rest takes place only after they follow the Ray back to the Central Sun, symbolized by the number 10. Thus, the Seventh Circle is not a place of rest. The 7 Circles and a cycle of 7, such as the days of the week, may be similar but are not really fractals of each other.

For about the last 10 years the verse “Spiral out. Keep going!” has been a bit of an inspirational mantra for me… why that might be is perhaps sinking in a little deeper now thanks to the text and your commentaries. Thanks!! (: the song is Lateralus by Tool if anyone cares… )

The association of Christ and the sun extends to Rudolf Steiner, who, like Fludd, was also closely associated with Rosicrucianism. “… evolving into habits that find their proper orbit and continue in it thereafter”. Are these unchangeable habits, and if so, what is another name for them, or are all habits unchangeable?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								November 14, 2018 at 3:22 pm							




David, there’s always the possibility of bilateral influence, and later on in the text we’ll get into how that works. (It has a lot to do with the possibilities of polarity magic and other forms of multiperson magical workings, among other things.) As for the end goal of the training, it’s considerably beyond having a “healthier mind,” whatever exactly that might be. Fortune is trying to teach you how to think like a mage, so that you can make full use of the toolkit of magical practices, and understand the deeper dimensions of occult philosophy. We’ll get to that, too, as the journey continues. 
Dewey, you’re welcome and thank you — I’m glad my commentary is helpful. As for sun worship, that’s quite true, of course. 
Dan, good. That’s the sort of thinking that makes for good meditations on this sort of symbolic system. 
Eduardo, you’re welcome and thank you. Just remember, you can use the time between now and December 12 to meditate on the text… 😉
Matt, it’s good advice! 
Case, there may also be a more direct connection between Fortune’s vision and Steiner’s, since both were profoundly influenced by the teachings of the Theosophical Society, and I think the term “solar logos” is Theosophical in origin. As for habits, like anything else in orbit, they follow their existing trajectory until something interferes with them. Any habit can be changed by replacing it with a different habit.

Thanks for your always helpful commentary, JMG! I have a couple of questions (naturally).
There’s a part of the text where Fortune talks about the great organisms bursting forth through the Ring-Pass-Not after the cosmos attains sufficient complexity. Is she using “Ring-Pass-Not” figuratively, to indicate the boundary of the Central Sun? Or is she indicating that eventually the most complex organisms actually slip the bounds of the cosmos which generated them and fly out into Unmanifest space? In other words, is she describing a matryoshka-doll process of endless internal complexification, or a Faustian one of endless outpouring into external space?
I’m also somewhat confused by her description of the Absolute rings as sentient but simple. Wouldn’t this conflict with her belief in Christian theokogt, which views the Creator as a being vastly more intelligent and complex than its creations? I had always understood this to be one of the major points of conflict between materialism and theism – that materialism posits a world that emerges from interactions between simple particles obeying simple rules, while theism posits a creation guided by an active intelligence.

John–
Re the end goal
Glad to hear that she gets to that!  As for a “healthier mind,” I have no idea what that might be either; I was just to relate what we’re doing here to the notion of an exercise manual.  That is, we are performing actions that don’t “do” anything (like running in a circle, for example, or lifting weights), but which develop capabilities (endurance, strength).  Knowing what the end goal is and understanding how the in question activities further that goal help (at least, help me) see the point in doing exercises that otherwise appear to be without purpose.  (Yes, I’m just running in a circle and going nowhere, but I’m building my cardiovascular capability and burning calories in the process.)  I’m working very hard  to roll with “train the mind, not inform it” while we wander about in metaphor 🙂
As has been mentioned above, your explication of this text has been invaluable to getting to this point.  Thank you.

“At every moment your consciousness and your life are being shaped by the forces of the cosmos; some of the ways in which this happens are obvious, but a great many more are not…To know those influences is to attain wisdom.”
One of the things I’ve noticed is that Faustian cultural influence is unavoidable right now. Even those of us who reject Progress, who reject the idea humans are beyond nature, show plenty of influences from the culture around us. If you name a religion alive in the west today, I guarantee you can find Faustian influence.
I suppose most would never notice; the fool would run from it, screaming about how everyone’s mind’s are influenced by the worldview but his; while the wise would take it for what it is, and accept that the thoughts he thinks are shaped by the culture in which he lives.
It’s an interesting thing to contemplate, but it seems especially important with many of the most destructive features of Faustian culture on full display right now, because one of the first steps in avoiding most such traps is admitting you can fall victim to them.

I had been reading her writings on the cabala at the same time (and now your Paths of Wisdom) and had assumed that the ten sides was a point toward adding the number ten, the ten spheres, to the special numbers provided so far (7,12,3). Dion does say else where that the first atoms are three sided – the lowest number of form, of course, so I assumed this was a “magic trick” of addition to show us the seven spheres below the abyss end in ten, even though three is the number of Binah, which is form’s introduction, even as it also stands for the first state of the cosmos bounded by the ring chaos. A fractal trick, if you will 😉

“Each traveling atom has gone out and back again along each of the twelve Rays, absorbing the influences of each Ray on each of the seven Circles or Cosmic planes of existence. Each of these atoms started out as a vortex of movement in space based on a simple geometrical pattern; each finishes its journey as a fantastically complex structure of forces in equilibrium, having experienced every possibility the cosmos has to offer and made each one of those possibilities part of its internal structure.”  
This seems like it might apply to Druid theories about reincarnation, emerging from Annwn and cycling through many experiences to get to Abred.  https://www.ecosophia.net/a-few-notes-on-reincarnation/
Going to do the broken record thing now and thank you again, JMG, for publishing this series.  I consider you the J.S. Bach of Western magic, truly.

Archdruid,
Here I’ve been freaking out that I haven’t at all understood what the cosmic doctrine was trying to say and just about ready to give up. This morning after a considerable amount of contemplation last night, I set out on a new project to study Egregors. However as I was doing my first meditation on the topic, I started using Models from the cosmic doctrine, and the short amount I wrote ended with the phrase “as above, so below.” Apparently I’m doing something right?
Regards,
Varun

This is the most comprehensible post I have seen yet! My understanding of these matters pretty much stopped at the Tree of Life, which I have a fairly good grasp of, so maybe it’s relating the Solar Logos to Tipareth that does it here And “The cosmos is fractal” also makes very good, clear sense to me, almost “Duh! Obvious!” 
Finally, “To know those influences is to attain wisdom. To wield them in harmony with the innate patterns and directions of the Cosmos is to become the equivalent of a traveling atom: in a phrase traditional among occultists, it is to enter onto the Path,” is precisely what I was groping for when asked “Why do you want to be a Witch?” Though back then, 28 years ago, I saw it more in terms of a river and a canoe-er paddling deftly through the rills and eddies. But that’s what I wanted, to know and navigate those currents. 
Thank you.

Fred, (1) she doesn’t make that clear. Remember that all this is metaphor, so you can apply the metaphor either way and see how well it works. 
(2) There we get into one of the huge differences between Fortune’s variety of Christianity and the orthodox kind. The Solar Logos, “without whom was not anything made that was made,” is the God of our solar system, and is a creative intelligence far greater and more subtle than human beings can imagine. The three Rings, which comprise God on the scale of the cosmos, are far vaster but far more simple, and the Absolute, which mystics tend to think of as God, is without history and without qualities — intelligence, please note, being a quality. So Fortune’s cosmos starts (in a certain sense) where materialism ends, and shows how gods emerge out of that. 
I’m reminded of an elegant little argument for the existence of at least one god that Gene Wolfe put into one of his science-fantasy novels. Either the universe was created, or it wasn’t. If it was created, someone had to create it, ergo there is at least one god. If it wasn’t created, then it has existed for infinite time, and given infinite time to work in, at least one intelligent being would have attained the qualities we normally associate with gods, ergo there is at least one god. QED!
David, fair enough! Exactly; this running in metaphoric circles is meant to give your mind the stamina and skills it needs for the hard work of occult philosophy and practice. 
Will, bingo. You and I cannot stop being what we are, and “what we are” includes a heavy dose of Faustian consciousness; if we pretend that isn’t the case, we fall victim to its influences all the more easily. If we accept it there’s at least the chance we can move away from its worst aspects toward its more constructive potentials. 
SaraDee, yes, and that’s also involved! There are many levels to the metaphor. 
Kimberly, thank you. I’m pretty sure that the implied reference to reincarnation was intended, as Fortune — like everyone else in the occult scene of her time — accepted reincarnation as a fact. 
Dennis, not at all. The path of occultism requires the full commitment of every capacity you’ve got; you need your brain, your heart, your guts, and everything else you have. This notion that you can achieve perfection by mutilating yourself, discarding or distancing yourself from some part of you that’s been arbitrarily labeled “bad,” is one of the worst hangovers of the Piscean era we have to deal with. 
Varun, indeed you are. Don’t worry about understanding the Cos.Doc.; it’s meant to train the mind, not to inform it. You don’t need to understand the physics of gravity to get a good workout with a barbell! 
Patricia, you’re welcome. Glad to hear it! One of the things you’ll find as we proceed is that things do get a little easier; Fortune started out with very basic, abstract concepts, and is moving closer to the universe that humans experience with every step. She’ll get all the way down to our reality in due time.

								November 15, 2018 at 12:01 am							




Hmm. I must admit I don’t like the fact I’m a Faustian intelligentsia, but I am what I am, and trying to be something else isn’t going to work. I guess this raises a rather odd question though: how can someone be what they are, when what they are is trying to be something else? I suspect that’s yet another theme for meditation, isn’t it?







 Will J says: 



								November 15, 2018 at 12:07 am							




One of the ironies of being influenced by Faustian culture is the fact that one of the core ideas of Faustian humanity is independence from the environment: “Of course my thoughts are my own, and have not been influenced by my culture!”
Suddenly, a lot of strange things make a lot more sense: if I just assume nearly everyone can’t see how their worldview is influenced by their environment, but see it as objective fact, it makes perfect sense people would find it so hard to deal with anyone disagreeing with them on anything: they can’t understand how anyone could see things differently, since their worldview is objectively true.







 Kimberly Steele says: 



								November 15, 2018 at 12:21 am							




Thanks, JMG, and to the commenters for their insights.  I meant to say the J.S. Bach of Western occultism.  
There’s a prayer in the Druid Magic Handbook that goes:
Grant, O holy ones, thy protection;
And in protection, strength;
And in strength, understanding;
And in understanding, knowledge;
And in knowledge, the knowledge of justice;
And in the knowledge of justice, the love of it;
And in that love, the love of all existences;
And in the love of all existences, the love of Earth our mother and all goodness.
Here is how I am attempting to connect it with the Cosmic Doctrine:
The Trinity is the Ring (protection), the Ring-chaos (strength), and understanding (Ring-Pass-Not)
Understanding to knowledge is the resulting twelve rays
Knowledge to knowledge of justice is the Circles or planes where “karma” as we know it is acted out
Prime Atoms are the resulting love of all existences
Recombination and return to the center is the love of Earth our mother and all goodness.
I sense that the prayer relates to Ogham symbolism as well but I have yet to crack the code.

“Watch your thoughts, they become words;

Not sure who coined this, has been used by Margaret Thatcher among others. Its a beauty, and seems to dovetail nicely with what your saying

ADJMG,
When you say the universe is fractal, to clarify what you mean is that in some ways and sometimes to humans  it appears to be fractal, but in occult theory it’s not an absolute, right?







 Scotlyn says:

JMG “You and I cannot stop being what we are, and “what we are” includes a heavy dose of Faustian consciousness; if we pretend that isn’t the case, we fall victim to its influences all the more easily. If we accept it there’s at least the chance we can move away from its worst aspects toward its more constructive potentials.”   
Slightly off topic (and being ON topic is going to take me a few days to mull, as usual) I can’t help feeling that if you substitute “racism” for “Faustian consciousness” you would have an important clue to some of the (other) cultural influences we are (mostly) falling victim to, rather that accepting them, and with that acceptance, receiving the chance to move away from their worst aspects…
The liberal game of “name/blame the racist” is premised on the idea that “I’m not one.”  But, it’s darn near impossible for anyone who grew up in our racist culture to have achieved a place of neutrality from which to be objective about the racism of others.  And, of course, no one likes being called a racist, at least, not by another racist, so the pretense keeps us all pretty firmly in racism’s grip, and liable for all the workings out of its long and complicated karma.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								November 15, 2018 at 12:43 pm							




Will, excellent! “Trying to be what you’re not” is a central theme of Faustian culture, and so part of accepting who you are is accepting that constant striving to be who you aren’t. As long as you realize that the striving never achieves its goal, that “who you aren’t” is at an infinite distance and so all your inevitable efforts in that direction will always fall short, it’s perfectly healthy. It’s those who convince themselves that they’ve achieved it who fall into the trap of bad faith Sartre discussed so incisively. As for the people who can’t see how their thoughts are shaped by their culture, that’s a huge point, and one that’s playing a massive role in the dysfunctions of our present culture. It’s not even that they don’t see it; it’s that they’re frantically running away from the recognition that, as the song says, they are what they are and they ain’t what they ain’t. That way lies madness, and I’m not talking in metaphorical terms here. 
Kimberly, wow. That works, and it’s not something I’d thought of, nor (to my knowledge) that anyone else has explored. Thank you; you’ve just built a bridge between Druidry and the Cos. Doc. that will bear much further travel. 
Tsutomu, a very solid point. There’s a slightly different version of the same saying in Druid circles, which (predictably) makes use of nature symbolism: 
“Sow a thought, reap a word;
Sow a word, reap an action;
Sow an action, reap a habit;
Sow a habit, reap a character;
Sow a character, reap a destiny.” 
Either way it’s excellent advice and good fodder for meditation. 
Dashui, good! I wondered if anyone would catch that. Yes, “the Cosmos is fractal” means, when translated into less gnomic form, “thinking of the Cosmos as fractal is a useful way to focus attention on some aspects of the universe of our experience not so well grasped by way of many other interpretive tools.” 
Scotlyn, I’m far from sure that the label “racist” actually means anything any more. If you want to talk about ethnic privilege, I’m all ears; if you want to talk about ethnic prejudice, ditto; but I’m increasingly scratching my head, trying to figure out what that word “racism” means — well, apart from a conflation of those two things backed up by a shriek of hatred and rage.







 Will J says: 



								November 15, 2018 at 1:38 pm							




I think racist these days usually means little more than “How dare you question my privileges?!”







 Dewey says: 



								November 15, 2018 at 1:56 pm							




Gene Wolfe’s argument creates a false dichotomy, because temporally finite things can and often do come into existence through mechanical or chance causes. Also, if the universe had existed for infinite time it would not follow that one or more entities in it must have attained godlike power; that attainment, like fast affordable interstellar travel, might be impossible, or it might be that almost-godlike beings reliably use their power to destroy their own peoples, or that the lifespan of a single solar system isn’t long enough to let them complete the process. It reminds me of Descartes’ arguments for the existence of the Christian God: sound good on the surface, but when looked at hard, totally bogus. (Although after reading Philosophy Between the Lines, I have a suspicion that Descartes knew that.)







 Scotlyn says: 



								November 15, 2018 at 4:10 pm							




“I’m far from sure the label “racist” actually means anything any more. If you want to talk about ethnic privilege, I’m all ears; if you want to talk about ethnic prejudice, ditto; but I’m increasingly scratching my head, trying to figure out what that word “racism” means.” 
I won’t belabour this, and will enter no more comments on this subject here, because it’s not at all topical. But it just seemed so apt (to me) to re-write your sentence and explain (to myself) a number of things that are occurring in my world.  
I think I’m not talking about a thing that IS, certainly not about a label, but about a cultural  consciousness and set of meanings that I know *I* was raised in.  In that cultural consciousness, people are categorised in various ways, but one of those ways of categorising that I learned (or maybe absorbed is more accurate) includes the use of racial categories. Black skin, white skin – they are assigned meanings in this cultural consciousness in which I was raised and those meanings still resonate within me.  
Therefore, to avail of the opportunity to change how racial meanings resonate within me (which I would very much like to do), means starting with an acceptance that those racial meanings are already constructed into my awareness and worldview, and so to get anywhere else, that is the very place where *I* have to start from.  The main reason it would not make sense, then, for *me* to call anyone else a racist, is not that there aren’t racists, it’s that, if I examine the cultural furnishings that my culture has given to my mind as its inheritance, I can see that  I myself am one.  
Anyway, I’m enjoying the exchanges between yourself and Will J, and so, please ignore my temporary excitability on this score.

Before we go on, I’ve fielded several comments that were completely off topic — as in, not even an attempt to relate them to anything anyone’s said this week — for this week’s post. Please read the last paragraph of the post. There’ll be an open post in the 28th, so please save your off-topic comments for that, and please save this conversation space for discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine and things at least peripherally related to it, or to something someone here said about it. Many thanks! 
With that said…
Will, I’m not at all sure I can find any reason to disagree. 
Dewey, good! Of course it’s not a conclusive argument. 
Scotlyn, fair enough. I know I have something of a kneejerk reaction to that word these days. The points Will J. have raised have set my mind racing — there’s something very important going on in the frantic attempt to push bad faith to its ultimate extreme, and I want to understand it.

@Scotlyn, you’re not only on to something, you’re using THE framework for anti – racist activist work that every good social justice group I have belonged to uses, good stuff! 🙂 
(and yes good social justice activism exists, though I know the majority posters on this forum have decided to take the Far Right’s word for what that means and sneer about “SJWs” instead. A habit which has nothing whatsoever to do with any of the environmental influences on thought patterns you have just described, and which social justice theory critiques, of course…nope….)

“[T]here’s something very important going on in the frantic attempt to push bad faith to its ultimate extreme”
Ah, isn’t that the logical result of Faustian culture though? You take whatever it is you want to be, run to its logical extreme, and then… Well I don’t think Faustian culture thinks that far ahead. But, even if you want to be spiritual, let’s say, it’s usually thought of as all or nothing: you’re either purely spiritual or not at all. The reality we live in, where everyone is partially there, but few reach the extremes that monks reach, for example, is ignored.
This is to say nothing of the fact that the material world is usually seen as the antithesis of the spiritual, and the fact monks still have to eat is used as evidence that even they are not “really spiritual” by some who wish to argue humanity is not spiritual, and never can be.
So, of course we would take bad faith to its logical extreme. It’s not even just civilizations tend to do it, but our culture loves the logical extreme. Faustian humanity loves to ignore the middle: we desperately try to pretend that there is nothing except for the extremes.
Since that is the reality, all of us in Faustian humanity are drawn to the extremes. This means, since most people (and, quite often, nearly everyone) are in the middle of things, neither perfectly left, nor perfectly right; neither perfectly good, nor perfectly evil; neither perfectly spiritual, nor perfectly atheistic; neither perfectly introverted nor perfectly extroverted; and on and on through the litanies of dualisms that Faustian humanity embraces, everyone in our culture wants to be something we aren’t.
But, it’s even worse than that: what we are is something utterly unthinkable: somewhere in between.

In the last paragraph of chapter six, we are encouraged to align our “ends with those of Cosmic evolution” so we may evolve to become Great Organisms ourselves. This seems like a tall order to follow, but I think we can use the Book of Nature to find some simple practices as a place to start. All the cycles mentioned in the Cosmic Doctrine, from the rotation of the Rings, the cycling of the Rays, and probably the rotation of the Circles follow a simple pattern of alternating positive and negative phases. In Nature there are three simple cycles that also follow this pattern of alternating polarity: the yearly cycle, the lunar cycle, and the daily cycle. Maybe a simple way to start harmonizing our energy with the greater Cosmic cycles is to align our lives with these natural cycles. Practices such as planting and harvesting by the lunar cycle and celebrating the yearly festivals such as found in the Druid spiritual path are two simple examples of ways to harmonize ourselves with Nature, and by extension the Cosmos. Mother Nature has within her the movements and memory of those who have already traveled the pathway to become Great Organisms. We just have to consciously begin to follow these paths, already written in the Book of Nature, in our lives.

“No atom goes twice around the Circuit; therefore the Central Stillness grows as evolution proceeds, and those atoms which have come home rest from their pilgrimage.”
That got me wondering…why doesn’t an atom go around again?  Is it because it has already experienced and learned from all the forces present in the Cosmos at the time, and there’s no point to going through it all again?  That would imply the purpose of the atom is to experience, learn and evolve.  Is that the purpose of the entire Cosmos?  It seems to be set up in order to allow the atoms to have the possibility of evolution.  
Looking again at “the Central Stillness grows as evolution proceeds.”  In other words, it gains somehow?  It gets bigger, grows in power?  This might imply that the Central Sun is helped by the atoms returning, and wants (needs?) the atoms to evolve and return to the Central Stillness.   I have noticed at times it has felt as though I was getting ‘help’ from an odd assortment of conscious beings on my personal journey on the path – is this because a conscious being (or beings) somehow want us all to succeed?
And moving on to “the organization of the Cosmos becomes so mighty in the force it has generated, that it bursts the Ring-Pass-Not, and the great organisms rush forth into the Unmanifest, and…in their turn build new Cosmoi.”
So the purpose of evolution is to build new Cosmoi and start the process all over again, eternally?  To what end?? I guess that’s one of those questions that may not be answerable by humans. It seems downright Faustian, although perhaps I am only interpreting it that way since my mind has been formed in a Faustian environment, and I can’t conceive of it any other way.   I get a few different impressions though…one is of escape, of bursting free from the Ring-Pass-Not.  Is the Central Sun in captivity somehow?  It also strikes me as a never-ending game being played on the part of the universe, although that impression feels quite cold.  What about love, which seems to play a big part in the path of initiation?  
I get the impression that the universe wants the atoms and great organisms to evolve in this manner, since the replication process of Cosmoi, or its underlying fractal nature is built right into its very structure.  So when we align ourselves with the forces of evolution, we are helping the universe to do what it has been seemingly set up to do.  As Dion says, “Should his ends be those of the Cosmic evolution he grows and develops through all its phases till he attains completeness, and…he gives rise himself to a system.”
Another impression that’s coming across is that the idea is not to be “right” all the time, (or, for that matter, wrong all the time), but actually to learn through experience, making many mistakes along the way.

By the gods, the insane moral posturing makes sense now! Faustian culture loves duality, so what is not perfectly good must be perfectly evil. Of course, no one wants to be evil, and Faustian culture also loves the idea of being what you want, not what you are, so everyone is certain that he is on the side of good.
The insane moral posturing is a logical outgrowth of this: since everything not perfectly good is evil, you need to repeatedly affirm your status as good, so that people know for sure you are, in fact good. More importantly, I think it’s also a way for Faustian humanity to reassure himself, he is, in fact, good.
Also, the obsession with differences rooted in biology makes sense, as Faustian Man tries to convince himself biology doesn’t matter at all. How does he deal with the fact that biology matters? By insisting it matters because we make it so!

SaraDee (if I may), I’m delighted to hear that there is, as you say, good social justice activism. I’d be even more delighted to see that in action from time to time, in place of the bullying, the hate speech, and the straightforward advocacy of hatred and violence against political enemies that so often goes on under the social justice label. In case you’re wondering, no, I didn’t get that impression from right-wing media; I got it firsthand from watching the science fiction community, among other subcultures, go through a very bad case of it — if you’re not familiar with RaceFail 2009, please do look it up sometime. 
Will, yes, but I think it goes further than that. The in-between space is something that Sartre explored in quite some detail; I foresee a close rereading of the relevant passages in Being and Nothingness soon…
Dan, excellent! Yes, very much so. 
Will, good. I suspect there’s another, in some ways simpler, aspect as well. A lot of people these days are caught in an extreme double bind — they believe (with good reason) that a modern industrial lifestyle is driving devastating environmental changes, and yet they continue to live a modern industrial lifestyle. Thus, by their own moral logic, they are evil, and yet they have to claim to be good. So they have to find someone else to be more evil than they are, so they can be good by comparison.







 Will J says: 



								November 15, 2018 at 11:43 pm							




JMG,
I should take a good read of Being and Nothingness myself.
As for the modern lifestyle driving extreme changes, I think that’s a good reason to think of yourself as flawed. Not evil, but flawed. Of course, flawed but redeemable is not something many people seem to acknowledge, which is a whole other issue.
This would also mean that the human condition, flawed, but not evil, would be intolerable. Hmm. A lot of the insanity could be related to refusing to accept that we are human, not something pure.

All–
I have to say this month’s discussion has sparked some fascinating commentary!
Re the Faustian tendency toward extremes
The first thing I thought as I read Will’s comment above was “Well, of course — optima  always occur at extrema,” translating everything (as  I tend to do) into math.  One of the standard results of optimization theory is that your optimal solution will occur at an “corner” of the solution space (an extremum point).
Then I realized that this standard result was for a certain (broad) category of optimization problems, namely those which deal with convex spaces (a brief definition of convexity: given two points in a space, any linear combination of those points is also contained within that space).  Given that “convexity” is a simplifying assumption which may or may not be true for a given space, I then wondered: what corresponding assumption might be being made in the Faustian worldview that would not necessarily hold true in reality?
Re “to what end”
Reading Stefania’s comment, which raised many points with which I wrestle myself, I heard that familiar voice from my meditations: “The point of the Dance is itself.”  I suspect I’m going to continue to receive that response to most of my questions…
Which also touches on our host’s reply to a previous weeks comment of mine wherein he observed that history is like a merry-go-round.  Perhaps the cosmic evolution is of a similar nature — that it is the process/experience, not an end result, that is the purpose of it all.

For JMG and Will J: “Hmm. I must admit I don’t like the fact I’m a Faustian intelligentsia, but I am what I am, and trying to be something else isn’t going to work. I guess this raises a rather odd question though: how can someone be what they are, when what they are is trying to be something else? I suspect that’s yet another theme for meditation, isn’t it?”
This is precisely why I was driven, against both the Zeitgeist and my own fundamentalistic upbringing, into accepting the doctrines of theosis, and spiritual practices designed to “open the channels of grace” so that contact (however limited) with higher reality could be established. It may look differently in people, but if Reality is transcendent at its highest level, and if the subtle rules the dense, then contact (again, however limited by mortal shortcomings and constraints) follows to be necessarily possible and desirable. Nicholas Berdyaev claims that man is not merely the Microcosm as the Renaissance made lucidly clear, but actually a Theocosm – the mystical dogmas/doctrines of the Church are filtered greatly through time and space (there is no doubt), however, the core teachings and practicum are operative. If enough internal friction builds up in the vice of this grip between who I am, and what I hope to become, it can transmute the inner being. The Russian connection (Bulgakov-Florensky-Mouravieff-Tomberg) is important in preserving these teachings (eg., Gnosis, Meditations on the Tarot).

Re convexity
After I hit “send” (of course), I thought of a visual example, to the extent anyone is interested 🙂
Consider the lunar cycle.  Any phase on the gibbous side of a half-moon would be convex, as one could connect any two points within that shape with a straight line which would also be contained entirely within that shape.  Once you are into the crescent phases, the shape is now concave (“not convex”), as it becomes possible to connect two interior points with a line that extends outside of the shape.
Returning to my question above, what analogous property might the Faustian worldview  be assuming (in its pursuit of extremes as optimal solutions) that is not actually true?

Huh, I had a weird thought on Faustian society: given the myth of progress, we reject everything the past has to offer. We also have a rich literary and cultural tradition from the classical world which tends to seek balance.
I wonder if our obsession with extremes is in someway related to refusing to recognize classical Greek influence on our civilization….







 SaraDee says: 



								November 16, 2018 at 1:53 pm							




@Phil Knight: do you not also hear the same thing with the use of “classist”? If not, why not? 
What I’d like the people here to imagine every time you saw someone post their disgust and relish at come uppance against the “SJWs” on this forum (SJW being the right wing manner of saying “THOSE people” – it is a slur) , you put the word “rednecks” instead. People here have happily grasped classism exists, while even being able to realize they’re IN the privileged class, and that’s uncomfortable, and they suddenly realize part of them is compelled to try to say “not me!” to resolve that moral impurity, that discomfort if they could… It’s the identical process I see when people realise what white privilege means. IDENTICAL. 
Will J’s thoughts are excellent, and on point, and the crux of our culture’s matter – and I have seen them all before in social justice spaces where people discuss what racism is and does (or sexism, or any other ism you’d like to scoff at), and how so much activism fractures specifically because of that drive to duality. Yes indeed, RaceFail 2009,and 2010, and, and, and… I’ve seen that, again and again, it drives good people out constantly – and posted about that before here – it was well received. What had not been well received is to bring up that the social justice groups that DON’T fracture – that continue to acknowledge there are core ideas they have within their critique of our Faustian culture that cannot be thrown out simply because people within our culture produced them and did what our culture does with them – have deliberately adopted the framework of “we’re all stewing in toxic worldviews, so we’re all compromised. Thus, no one is disposable, everyone has to be kept in the community, otherwise we fail.” those with the most powerful teachings tend to be quieter groups, who receive only serious students who seek them the right way so they don’t bring in people wanting to just blow stuff up, as anyone who studies the occult knows 😉
To create that community despite the stew is The Work. Community with the rest of the beings on the earth, despite the fact many of them want to kill you or liquify your insides to spread their spore capsules, or were simply in the way of a fast buck… with other humans despite much the same problems (less so the liquifying). Someone above asked – what about love? That’s the love. It’s not individual evolution out, the end is not just being Perfectly Oneself- it’s the individuals going back as Perfectly Oneself learning *how to come back in after they’ve taken on their individuality* to be Perfectly *Ourselves* again.
To use the Cos Doc –
It’s the start of evolution for atoms that are the same to be united in the Sun. But at the end of each cycle of evolution, atoms with the irreducible differences that come from their individual travels rest again, following the same inflowing forces, adding to the central stillness with their individual learnings. I suppose after that, they burst out and go on to join the Unmanifest, starting the movement, perhaps, that forms new cosmoi that have to learn something else or the same thing, in a different way.

Dear argusandphoenix:  On the subject of theosis and “opening the channels of grace’: 
	In conversing with someone who claimed to be able to see people’s past lives, a question arose in my mind I have been turning over since. I think this post may even be on-topic with CosDoc! 
         We started from the premise that some part of us is already divine; there is the notion that we each contain a ‘divine spark’ that is the part of us that stays the same through multiple incarnations. 
	If that is true, and we are, in a limited sense, already divine–why on earth do we subject ourselves to all the trouble of living multiple human lives? What is the point of being here? 
	Part of the answer might be that we need to learn how to ‘open the channels of grace’ so that the part of our Self that ‘stands perpetually in the presence of God’ can flow into our conscious minds, into our worldly lives, and out from us into our world.
	Another part–and this is the one that blows me away—may be that the divine part NEEDS whatever it is we acquire in our fourscore and ten or so years of mortal life at this exact time in history and in this exact place.  Shakespeare’s King Lear speculates that we humans are ‘god’s spies’.
	So, I have to start taking very seriously the possibility that the purpose of my life is not just to transcend material reality, but to live it to the concrete, fleshly, worldly max. 
	Maybe all the worldlings are doing the right thing!

Though our own modern society suffers for a dearth of such stories, one common theme among peoples everywhere is the story of a kid who seeks out the old mage, has a long apprenticeship that involves lots of hardship and hauling buckets of water uphill for reasons that only become apparent later, and the eventual mastery of wizardry, kung fu, musicianship, and ultimately of self.  I think this directly applies to the CosDoc so far and especially this lesson with its traveling atoms that finally return home at long last. 
Our culture, though, has huge problems because our current appointed wizards are all of the wealthy robber baron type or are clueless elites who haplessly fell into positions of great power and influence, only to abuse their privileges.  We lost craftsmanship and the apprenticeships that went with it somewhere in the 20th century and replaced it with cheap, disposable landfill fodder.  It’s distressing when you realize the modern world you live in has almost no forms of available fulfilling employment — it’s either invent your own niche job and be willing to starve, as I did and was, or enter a meaningless race to be the best office plankton you can be right before your retirement savings gets snatched away by a random medical event.  The only answer I can see for this is to stop competing in the bizarre race all of these people are running to the death.  So many think of a skill that takes an entire lifetime of dedication (more like several lifetimes) as a “hobby” and therefore essentially not worth doing.  It’s also bizarre but not surprising that a spiritual path is seen as a quirky, quaint way of accessorizing one’s life instead of returning to the essence of one’s being.

@JMG on your comments to Scotlyn, others
The extremes of bad faith and emotional coverup suggest a covert Game, in the Transactional Analysis sense, is (unconsciously) being used to freeze into place the (failing) macro Rescue Games of the current intelligentsia.
Alas, I can’t identify it any better than that.







 Will J says: 



								November 16, 2018 at 5:53 pm							




JMG,
Two more comments on Faustian culture: with regards to the way environmental destruction unfolds from our lifestyles producing a nasty double bind, there’s another key to that: by Faustian culture’s logic, this shouldn’t happen, since people ought to be able to change their own lives. Of course, there are systemic factors here, but I wonder if a large amount of the paranoia in our culture is a desperate attempt to convince ourselves that there are factors that keep us from doing what we think is right, when deep down we don’t admit they’re real.
Second, we are obsessed with explosions, both literal and metaphorical, and I wonder if the desperate attempts to push bad faith to their logical extreme are a result of strongly desiring an explosion, and pursing bad faith as a way to get there: “If we’re going to lose, we might as well lose in the most spectacular way possible, and take out as much of everything else as possible!”

Hi John Michael,
Maybe it is just me, but I’m entirely comfortable with not being at the top of the food chain, and in fact being only one among many. It is not lost on me after all that this solar system is only one among many, so I hardly feel that there is some sort of special pass – even though there may be assistance, if the price for that assistance is/was paid. Even those who are far above me are held in thrall to their destiny – and I’m self aware enough to see that, but at the same time, I can still have respect for those others. It is complex.
You know, I’ve been recently coming to understand that my wiggle room comes from the stories I share.
Have you ever considered the situation from that perspective and what do you reckon about my observation?
Cheers

KKA, you raise great questions, but the ending answer is capable of being greatly misunderstood: that is, I agree with what you mean, but not how you say it. Someone might use it as an opportunity to veer to the right or to the left. Part of our trial of crucifixion is to hold one point without wavering or flinching – the very point of Incarnation itself after all. But, that being said, I think it was what Jesus had in mind when he said “the children of this world are wiser in this generation than the children of the Light”. But he still distinguishes children of the Light – there’s a difference in the end between succumbing to a trial or temptation, and continuing to resist it, or struggle with it. So I can’t endorse materialistic secularism, although we can learn from it. Great questions though – a lot of the German mystical writings (Eckhart for instance) pertain to that topic of Who is doing the experiencing and Why? The Image of God is latent in us, but we have to co-create His likeness. The Church has totally forgotten the second part. Isn’t this what you are getting at with some of these questions?

The usual Saturday morning discussion with my intuitive, artistic better half induced some insight into my previously-posed question, as well as an observation regarding this month’s reading.  It all connects in the end, if you’ll bear with me for a bit.
First, the observation, which ties in later as well.  The rhythm of Day and Night, the sequence of activity and rest, the atoms/systems/Organisms cycling for a time then settling into the Central Stillness for a time — all of this reminded me (again) of the contrast of Nature and the linearity of typical modern thought.  That there is a time to be active and a time to be passive, that it sin’t always all-the-time-in-this direction-full-steam-ahead is rather antithetical to our society’s (Faustian) view. (This is hardly a new insight, but I need repetition it appears.)
To return to my mathematical analogy, it occurred to me that one of the important consequences of convexity comes into play when seeking those optimal points.  Think of it as looking for the top of the highest peak, while only being able to see your immediate surroundings.  Convexity ensures that there is only one peak, that your are on one mountain, and therefore if you simply keep moving “up” then you will eventually reach that peak.  (Indeed, if you always seek out the most severe incline, then you’ll reach that peak in the shortest possible time — this is known as the “steepest ascent algorithm”).  What convexity guarantees is that you never have to “go down in order to go up,” that you’ll never get trapped at a local maximum that is lower than the absolute maximum (that is, a smaller hilltop next to the mountain) because those hills don’t exist in a convex space.
Faustian insistence on extremity in a the one “true” direction strikes me as being very similar to this steepest ascent algorithm.  We must keep going “up” and doing it efficiently means seeking out the steepest slope.  Where this algorithm fails is when it encounters not a single mountain but a mountain range with peaks and valleys, where one may indeed have to descend in order to ascend.
Similarly, the insistence on all activity all the time, rather than cycles of activity and rest, represents a convex view of existence.  it is indeed a significant contrast as I consider the two perspectives.
(And apologies to all for my math geekery.  It helps me frame things.)







 Will J says: 



								November 17, 2018 at 2:36 pm							




I’m beginning to think pushing bad faith to its logical extreme is over-determined, since I have another possible explanation: the self-identity Faustian humanity likes is, frankly, absurd. It’s not based on what we really are, but rather its based on what we want to be. There’s no need to acknowledge the real you, since what’s important is who you want to be.
This is fine, as long as the image of who you want to be is close enough to who you really are. If they diverge, then bad faith is the logical result. It also doesn’t help that people are desperate for an identity of any sort, and so will grab whatever’s available. I think it’s not a coincidence that the extremes of bad faith have emerged when events started which prove that the two political parties are based on lies: the Democrats, rhetoric aside, are committed to the existing order of things, while the Republicans under Trump, again, rhetoric aside, are pushing to change things, both of which drastically contradict their self image.
Meanwhile, neither side is engaged in particularly moral actions, which, again contradicts the image of the “good people” they project on themselves. And, since the Faustian worldview says we are what we want to be, regardless of the reality, the results include an enormous amount of cognitive dissonance.
Finally, the other weird thing I’m mulling over right now is this question: if you already think of yourself as being who you want to be, is the any incentive to change? Because I find it ironic that, whenever people I know are able to, they tend pursue the same kind of stasis that they project on the past in their personal lives. The idea we live in an exceptionally dynamic, vibrant society, but with a static, unchanging personal life could also cause some intense cognitive dissonance.

Will, that’s an excellent point. The notion that human beings can be pure…hmm. I’m going to want to brood on this for a while. 
David, “optima always occur at extrema” — is that by any chance from von Neumann’s game theory? I know one of the points he made is that it’s impossible to maximize more than one variable at a time, so that the optimum for one variable is inevitably the pessimum  for at least some and usually many others. That’s valid for human life generally; compromise, by foregoing extremes, generates better results across the whole range of human variables. 
Argusandphoenix, and that’s certainly one way to go about it; if it works for you, excellent. 
David, I have a relentlessly unmathematical mind, and am not at all sure how concavity and convexity apply to solutions! 
Phil K., liberalism started out as an offshoot of Christianity, so that’s not surprising. 
Will, interesting. Certainly the current rejection of classical learning could well be tied into that. 
SaraDee, fair enough. I think, though, that there’s some serious false equivalency going on in your comparison of social justice activists to rednecks. What irritates many people about the social justice scene has nothing to do with the class, ethnicity, gender, or other (more or less arbitrary) categories to which its members belong, and everything to do with the ideas being pushed by the great majority of those who make a public show of commitment to social justice. “Redneck” is a label for an ethnic subset of a social class; “SJW” is a label for an ideology. 
That matters because it’s the ideology, and the behaviors guided by the ideology, that are what many of us object to — and because arguments like the one you’re using here, implying that challenging social justice ideology can be equated with class bigotry against rednecks, function as an attempt to shield the ideology from criticism. The insistence that everyone is immersed in a toxic worldview is equally defensive in its effect, since it blocks criticism of the ideology according to which worldviews are judged to be toxic. If we’re all horrible racists, after all, how can we trust ourselves to assess the standards by which we’re all being defined as horrible racists? 
But all this is raising some huge questions in my mind, about which I’m going to need to do a lot of brooding. 
Kimberly, an excellent point. I should do a post on Apollonius of Tyana sometime soon, because he came up with an effective response to the same problem. 
Jeffrey, that’s very plausible. Hmm! 
Will, both those make rather too much sense. 
Tude, you’re most welcome. I remember how hard a slog my first pass through the Cos. Doc. was! 
Chris, it’s not just you, but a lot of other members of our species don’t share that ability to be comfortable with reality. The major occult schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries labored long and hard to try to get people to realize the very modest place we have in the great scheme of things, but never got it to spread very far beyond their own membership. As for your observation — when you say “the stories you share,” do you mean the ones you have in common with other people, or the ones you introduce to other people? 
David, I more or less get what you’ve said, mostly via the metaphors. What happens, though, if you’ve got more than one variable to take into account? To extend the metaphor, optimizing the view is one goal, and takes you up a mountain, but having enough oxygen to breathe is another goal, which may get in the way of the first goal…
Will, you’re just knocking ’em out of the park. Much to think about here.
Phil K., I second the nomination!

@ JMG
The result would be from linear optimization theory, of which von Neumann was one of the major researchers.  (So, linearity might be another assumption to be examined.)  Absolutely — when one gets into multi-objective optimization, things get much fuzzier.
There are numerous issues involved: from the nature of the constraints defining the solution space, to the form of the objective function to be optimized, to the “shape” of the space in question (convexity/concavity being one particular kind of property).  Simplifying assumptions can make the computations easier, but then there is always the question of mapping back to reality…
What this whole train of thought brought to my mind was your image in A World Full of Gods of a ring of mountains, rather than a single mountain, for the spiritual seeker.  In the latter case, one has a convex space and the steepest ascent algorithm works; in the former, one has a concave space and the algorithm will not necessarily take you to where you want to go.

This in-depth study of the Cosmic Doctrine must survive the Age of the Internet.  Too many people in this and future societies need it.  
The mother of a friend of mine is visiting her adult daughter and my friend reports that a toxic mood has her questioning why my friend is not “further in life”.  Simply it is exactly what Will J. is talking about — the Faustian narrative of upwards and outwards, striving for the perfect life that is a trap by design, too miserable and consumed with achieving the pinnacle of success to smell the roses trampled underfoot.  My friend has two healthy children, a friendly ex-husband, and is a sweet, insightful, kind human being as well as a good mom.  I’m not sure what else one is supposed to achieve in this lifetime — at least from my simpleton’s point of view, I think she has made it.  She’s not rich or famous though, so according to trendsetters, she is behind.
I was meditating on the Ogham tree letter Gort today, which is Ivy.  I see Ogham letters as having three sides: one well-dignified state of balance and two potential types of imbalance when the tile turns up ill-dignified.  One state of imbalance is excess and one is dearth/not enough.  Ivy, which I personally comprehend as “perseverance”, is a great letter when it is in balance: it’s success after hard work, tenacity, weathering storms.  In excess, it’s our time: too much riches and bounty and you fail to appreciate fine and fleeting luxuries, like the obscene selection of imported olives at the grocery store where winter winds blow outside, and we all know the olive bar is just the beginning of the decadence everyone seems to take for granted. Excess prosperity and humans gorge like Wendigos while stealing from future generations.  In dearth, it’s weakness, inertia, and pusillanimous surrender because of the debilitating cognitive dissonance that sets in when you sense you cannot have all the cake and eat it too. 
Where the Cosmic Doctrine depicts the Universe moving in loops and ripples, times of growth and times of falling leaves returning to their roots, the Faustian version is a straight arrow pointed at outer space with no other possible alternatives. In other words, it is a recipe for failure, disaster, or both.  
I’m embarrassed to admit I did not know of Apollonius of Tyana.  I have now looked him up, of course.  He was a Neo-Pythagorean contemporary of Jesus.  Basically I consider this blog to my continuing real college education, twenty-three years after the expensive one.

Another way of describing a travelling atom perhaps is “Not all those who wander are lost”
It is no doubt taking the metaphor too far, and almost off-topic, but I cannot help but to think of Tolkien’s memorable poem:
    All that is gold does not glitter,
    Not all those who wander are lost;
    The old that is strong does not wither,
    Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
    From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,
    A light from the shadows shall spring;
    Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
    The crownless again shall be king.

On Druidry, ‘Protection’ and a bridge to Cosmic Doctrine
Please forgive the somewhat speculative nature of this comment.  I guess I am using the thinking space to probe my own thought. 
Despite limits imposed by the ‘laws’ of consequences, I am aware of a sense of protection, perhaps a Sphere of Protection: but, why ‘protection’ for me and my privilege? ‘Solar’ seems the singularity, the gift that goes on giving to life, without much discrimination. ‘Protection’ thus might seem a bit odd for any individual if we must define the world in terms of ‘winners and losers’, predator/prey, host/parasite, friend/foe.  My survival might be your disease? 
And what avails protection when the very exacting process of change that we call energy (as in ‘physics’) must flow forever in one direction?. And of course we build a life at the expense of other lives. Nevertheless, more concretely perhaps in human life, what if to ask for ‘protection’, (as in the Druid Magic Handbook recently referenced by Kimberly), is not to ask for privilege, but rather to prepare  a kind of sanity? Sanity could be a form of knowledge – not necessarily identical with rationality, but a ‘building-from-the-ground-up’ that makes enough room for love, whereas justice if left uncompleted by charity might keep us undeserving?  
Can we sensibly use intention to align a sensibility? I sense that if we can make the move we enter upon ‘a large and open space’, or from another metaphor:  ‘Charity … a tent with an open door for our mind / beyond is a vision of firelight / provisional humanity and open ground’.

Phil H
PS By a round-about route I have just re-read your essay on Schopenhauer (Feb. 2017) ‘The World as Will’ and your insight: “If he’s right, then the universe is not rational. Reason—the disciplined use of the grade of will I’ve called the intellect—isn’t a key to the truth of things.” My speculation is that sanity as I refer to it, is a matter more of recognition and being recognised?

John—
Your patient acceptance of limitations still surprises, even after these many years of discussions on your blogs 🙂  Only enough to climb one mountain (and perhaps only enough to get part way up one mountain); two and half more years to complete a project; the death of our civilization; the messy, irrational, irritable nature of human interactions (particularly politics).  I realize that, in the end, we have no choice about the reality of these things, but still, I find myself a good ways from being able to (continuously) accept them — I have good days and bad days, I guess.
More on the point of this month’s reading, however, I do have another question.  (Ok, a series of questions, it turns out.). During the discussion on the An Infinite Path podcast, you spoke of that five-fold layout of the planes, but also of those above and below that range.  IIRC, you mentioned that because of our limited perspective, we are essentially modeling (I’m translating here) the interactions of the higher planes “as though” everything originates from the spritual planes and moves downward from there, but that there in fact planes above what we see as the source which feed into that plane.
First, did I understand that discussion properly?  Secondly, and this gets to the aspect of the fractal nature of existence as mentioned in the discussions above, does this regression into higher (and I suppose, lower) planes continue ad infinitum?  That is, in the context of our image of nested cosmoi and trinities of rings, is there an “outermost” cosmos, a “highest” plane, that contains all, or is it elephants all the way down?  
We are working with metaphors, I understand; but I find myself thinking of the number line, which continues infinitely in both directions (higher and lower), versus a line segment (bounded in each direction, with a highest and lowest element) or a ray (bounded at one end, but unbounded in either the higher or lower direction).
Using that number line metaphor, what is it about the material plane that makes it the appropriate zero point, and why would lower planes (negative numbers) be “bad”, if indeed they are?  If the etheric plane were the demarcation point, for example, then the material plane would be -1.  Do enteric entities consider material incarnations daemonic, as we would consider the denizens of the lower planes?  Is it simply a matter of relative perspective?

I have a new contender for “cause of insanity around us”: Faustian culture says we are what we want to be. This includes thinking about what we want to think about. It’s also rigidly dualistic, so anything negative means you must be a negative person, which means you must want to be a negative person.
So, anyone who even notices the impending disasters, the collapse of civilization, mass die off, etc, must want it. This is fine for believers in apocalypse, since it’s a purifying disaster, and things will get better after. For anyone who can’t see the upside for it, however, even thinking a disaster is possible is enough to make them, by their own logic, horrible monsters.
The cult of positive thinking is one outcome, but the other, far more insidious, is the frantic attempt to convince yourself that the future must be better, and that even if things go wrong, they’ll turn it fine in the end. Finally, it also explains the increasingly frantic efforts to avoid noticing anything is wrong at all with the world, since to even admit to it is to admit to being a monster who wants everyone to die.
I’ve also thought about it some more, and the stasis we project onto others is probably an attempt to run from the fact we pursue stasis in our own lives. Of course we would though: we are already what we want to be, so why change? Any change would be going further from the ideal, so why do it?
And thus why we worship TV and the internet, as mediums to keep us from having free time, because we might use the free time to change things. The horror!
Phil,
I think that might be it! I’ll challenge you with a question though: what’s the most Faustian thing you do? I think mine would be D&D and other RPGs, which play with the being what you want inherent to Faustian culture. I’ve noted before that it doesn’t seem fun to play an RPG where you’re playing yourself, or where someone else has made the character, which suggests to me that the escapism is a big part of it.







 Will J says:

One other thing that I also want to consider is that Faustian culture has a powerful sense of certainty and a powerful ability to strive for the impossible. Both of those could be useful, if directed in productive ways. I’m not sure how to use it yet, but I figure after tearing apart Faustian culture I should aim to look for something positive in it 😉







 SaraDee says: 



								November 18, 2018 at 12:36 pm							




@JMG, Hmmm, yes, I see – I was raised in a town where “being redneck” and “redneck life “was an ideology, albeit unspelled out, which was completely arbitrary and did not follow simply from social class and wage. What do you mean not everyone shares my inner head definitions? 
The definition involved, among many of things, silly things like avoiding reading, under the mistaken impression this would turn one effete and unable to now work with one’s hands, or too big for one’s britches. If the person you were speaking to had any whiff of a book learnin’ vocabulary, you could dismiss anything they said out of hand. This of course is something being deliberately cultivated by The Powers That Be to ensure at no time do the labouring classes get sedulous ideas from books or anarchist university students and rise up again like the original Rednecks. But it also means that a lot of very bad ideas get artificially tacked on and expounded into ideology when all that the term can reasonably be agreed to mean is “rural tradesworker”. 
Redneck ideology also involved a lot of faith in Faustian/Calvinist ideas about what good working men deserve, by God, which resulted in a lot of domestic violence, sexual asault, rampant racism against them undeserving Indians; as well as men dying early of alcoholism, drug abuse and untreated diseases because real men don’t feel pain. My stepdad actively eschewed the former parts of the identity, yet still succumbed unfortunately to the latter. 
In short, when someone says they’re a proud redneck, it conjures a lot of things about what values they hold, which may or may not overlap with what values they actually hold, or intended to convey in addition to “rural trades worker”. Until you interact with them, personally, you don’t know what portion or extreme of the ideology they have internalized as important to the identity, or what additional assumptions about that identity means in their part of the world. 
Enter, when someone says “I engage in social justice work” (at no time has a person adopted the term SJW for themself, it’s meaning had never been other than derision), what we know for sure is that they intend to tell you “I believe inequalities exist in the treatment people get in this world due to systemic underlying assumptions about race, gender, body size, class, sexual orientation, etc.”. That’s all the word racism means. Systemic discrimination due to socially constructed racial classification. But you don’t know which ones they prioritize, to what extremes they take that ideology – whether what they do would actually align with the bullying behaviour you mean when you say “SJW”. 
So what I see constantly, is someone makes a statement which uses the single word” racism” in it, and now they can be wholly dismissed, because that conjures in the readers /listeners head all sorts of ideas about what someone else once said when they used that one word, without actually paying any attention to what this person is actually saying this time. Just the same way someone from the coast would dismiss someone unfairly by saying “redneck” because they share MY mental image of what that isotopes could entail.







 Will J says: 



								November 18, 2018 at 12:38 pm							




David,
I think you and JMG have nailed the reasons we go off to extremes: we focus on a single variable at a time. Witness our great intellectual achievement, science: it works only as long as we can control everything except what we’re interested in.
So, since we only ever look at one variable, we lose nuance, and run off to the extremes. And of course the arguments between people never goes anywhere, since they aren’t even arguing about the same things, since both sides have found a different variable to maximize, at the expense of the variable the other side has maximized.
I’m still not sure where the dualism comes from though, but then again the idea we should be able to understand everything is absurd. I am, however, Faustian, and so a part of me rebels at the idea of accepting that I just don’t know.







 SaraDee says: 



								November 18, 2018 at 1:09 pm							




@JMG, my apologies, I’m not a concise thinker… But I can put it more simply in the form of the Cabala, perhaps not the Cos Doc. I social justice is an ideology, which it is, a framework for explain the world, and how to move ethically and rightly in it – then on the way through the Vail, many fall to the traps on the paths of Ayin or Nun. The behaviours labelled as SJW are those of people who have glimpsed the power structure we seek to understand in Tipareth, but stop there and deploy it for their own ends, the dark pitfall of Ayin. Those who decide to turn back because they see their own enmeshment in the system, and decide that is all they are, and there is no way to rise above it fall to quiescence on the Path of Nun. In all trying to decide what those who realize both those mistakes are folly, but then turn back wholly and decide no ism really exists at all are, metaphorically… Perhaps those who mistake all as mere illusion, and fall victim to the negative powers of Yesod…?

Peter, I don’t think that’s inappropriate at all. You could see the second half of the poem, in fact, as a set of metaphors for the end of the negative period of the cosmos and the beginning of a new phase of activity. 
Phil H., this seems very sensible to me. Protection as sanity — yes, and also protection as the establishment of mutual boundaries, so that my sphere of protection also limits me from encroaching on yours. While it’s true that all living things feed on other living things, furthermore, there’s an astonishing generosity in the structure of the food chain — from the base to the apex, everything gets to eat and eat and eat over and over again, and only has to be eaten once.  😉
David, yes, you followed that correctly. The answer to your second question, though, is presupposed by your initial comment! It’s simply this: we don’t know. What’s more, we can’t know — the spiritual plane isn’t just as far up as we can perceive, it’s as far up as we can think or imagine, in any sense but the wholly arbitrary one that allows us to posit the abstract notion of “something further up.’ In the same way, we can neither perceive nor imagine the submaterial planes in any but that same arbitrary sense. 
As for beings whose lowest level of manifestation is the etheric plane, they probably aren’t aware of material beings at all. There’s a teaching in a variety of occult schools that has it that our interactions with the next plane down are the result of certain events that happened well back in human evolution, of which fragmentary memories come down to us in the various myths of the Fall. If a similar event didn’t happen in the evolution of etheric beings — and the idea seems to be that what happened with us was an anomaly — there wouldn’t be a similar experience. 
Will, keep going. I think you’re on to something very useful indeed. You’re right that Faustian culture also has immense positive potential — like every other great culture, it takes one vision of human existence and pushes it as far as it will go, “down to Gehenna or up to the Throne” — and the upside and the downside both have to be grasped to get a clear picture of the whole.

@ Will J
Re optimization and extremes
Yes, the thing about optimization is that it is always with respect to a specific objective function (the thing to be optimized).  Choose a different objective function, and the optimal solution—even with regard to the same set of constraints—will change accordingly.  So one of the points of confusion is that different people holding different values have different objective functions and can’t understand why the other is insisting that their solution is the “right” one when it is so clearly suboptimal and “wrong”…
Just recently, I had a polite but pointed conversation with our former city council president (a wonderfully-opinionated, firecracker of a woman in her early eighties) re this recent boondoggle in Baraboo with Nazi salutes in a junior prom photo.  She was quite vociferous in her view that the district should take those boys to the cleaners. I pointed out that freedom of speech is not dependent on whether or not one agrees with its content.  She, being of a different generation, was appalled at the insult to those who died to protect that freedom, to which I responded, “And yet one still has the right to burn the flag.  You don’t have to like it, but you do have to allow it.”  Different values, different perspectives, different versions of “right.”







 John Michael Greer says: 



								November 18, 2018 at 2:40 pm							




SaraDee, interesting. Of course terms like “redneck” and “social justice activist” are contested in meaning, partly because of different agendas on the part of the speakers and partly because of actual differences in the landscape of experience being addressed. For example, in the redneck cultures I’ve interacted with directly — in certain parts of western Washington state and in the north central Appalachians — avoiding reading wasn’t part of the local culture at all; many of the women devoured romance novels and Christian periodicals such as Guideposts; the men tended to be less into reading but took in the occasional Western or Tom Clancy-style military thriller, or subscribed to hunting magazines and the like. The bitter experience of deindustrialization in western Maryland also made a big difference in expectations, too, because everyone knew good men who’d done everything right, and still ended up jobless and hopeless and having a 12-gauge round for breakfast one fine day — that was a phrase I heard rather more than once. 
I’m a little perplexed by your claim that the phrase “social justice warrior” was never something anyone called themselves — au contraire, I recall seeing it flung around quite freely online by social justice activists for about a year, until the right picked it up and started making hay with it, at which time it was dropped by the left like a hot rock. Here again, though, our experiences differ; I don’t doubt that you’ve met plenty of people who use the term “social justice” in the sense you’ve given it, but that doesn’t justify your claim that that’s the only sense that can or should be given it. The famous “no true Scotsman” fallacy applies here; it’s convenient but, I’d argue, unfair to claim that the abuses so widely committed in the name of social justice are somehow separate from the ideology that is so freely used to justify and condone them. 
Your Cabalistic analysis is interesting and potentially very useful, but I’d suggest a different way of looking at it. The great challenges in the ascent to Tiphareth are two. The first, as you’ve indicated, is that of falling into the clutches of one of the two guardians on either side of the Middle Pillar — the Path of Ayin and Nun, which it seems to me you’ve characterized quite accurately here. The second is that of achieving balance in the sixth sphere once you’ve gotten there, rather than falling under the sway of the Tagiriron, the qlippah of Tiphareth. The Tagiriron, as you’ll doubtless recall, are the Disputers, and what characterizes the people who are subject to their influence is the insistence that they and they alone know the truth, and everyone who disagrees with them is wrong, wrong, WRONG! What makes the Tagiriron so dangerous is precisely that they’re a simulacrum of Tiphareth rather than the thing itself, and people can very easily get caught up in the simulacrum while being sure they’re in the real thing. I see a lot of social justice activists inhabiting this space — sure that they’re living lives of justice and goodness while engaging in bullying behavior indistinguishable from that of the people they hate. 
One further thing. I get the impression — and please correct me if I’m wrong — that you think that by rejecting the current use of the term “racism” I’m denying the existence of ethnic privilege and ethnic prejudice in today’s America. That’s not the case at all. What I’m challenging is the rhetorical game that conflates privilege with prejudice, and insists that if you’ve got the one you must necessarily have, and thus can be blamed for, the other. In the real world, by contrast, you can have privilege without prejudice, and you can also have prejudice without privilege; furthermore, neither you nor I nor anyone else can change our condition of privilege, but we can certainly learn to dispense with our prejudices. The insistence that this can’t happen, that if you’re born into privilege you’re inevitably tarred with prejudice, is among other things a very effective way to covertly excuse a refusal to change…

I suppose the most Faustian thing I do is that I’m a historian of military technology (amongst other things).
It’s very difficult not to be impressed by the sheer power of massed 20th Century weaponry, and i think this is one of the things that future civilisations will really envy about us.
One of the oddest aspects of Faustians is their insistence on being armed to the teeth, and their equal insistence that they hate war.  I suspect that future civilisations, like previous ones, will be much more honest in their enthusiasm for violent conflict.

Hi John Michael,
Thanks. I reckon the word ‘infinitesimal’ may not be quite appropriate, but it is close. 😉 The Universe is a way big place.
Oh! Ah, clarity of written thought is a complex skill. Well both of those explanations, but as a third option, I also like introducing the tools for decision making processes that may work better in a declining society – by providing solid examples of my own actions. It may be a sweeping generalisation, but I reckon a lot of people don’t have the mental tools with which to move in a different direction away from than the dominant narrative, and the stories I write often expose the way I’ve had to wiggle through the swampy morass of difficulties that I regularly (and so do most people) encounter.
Plus there is also the advantage that I enjoy of having some minor status within the community (as a recognised professional) and undertaking hard, complex physical labour. Getting that concept across, is not as easy as you’d think. The powers of the dark side is strong! 😉
But the stories themselves show how little wiggle room that I have to exercise – and this week was no exception. Still with a lot of personal effort there is still some to be found. What do you reckon about that?
Cheers
Chris

Chris, well, living a story is far and away the most powerful way of telling it, so I think you probably have a handle on something very useful. 
David, it’s a major challenge in this culture to grasp the reality of limits. I suspect that bedevils all of us from time to time. 
Sven, I’ve come to think that Rev. Robert Kirk, he of The Secret Commonwealth fame, was more accurate than were my earlier speculations on that subject. He argued that elves do in fact have bodies on the physical plane, just not as dense and obvious as ours; this is why they interact so freely with physical matter and physically incarnate beings. 
Will, by all means! 
David, good question. You’ll have to ask a being who knows more than the five planes we can access! The image of an elephant standing on its own back is a fine bit of surrealism, btw. 😉

David re: the dance itself
I was starting to feel frustrated about not being able to make heads or tails out of the Cos Doc, and your comment really helped to put things in perspective, so thank you very much. 
I think I lost sight of the part about ‘training the mind, not informing’ it.  I can almost see why the book would be written in such an abstract way – the danger lies in the reader thinking they have understood everything with their regular mind, but the higher intellectual mind has actually not been engaged. The change of consciousness through meditation resulting in gnosis has not happened.  I tend towards the overly-analytical in my thought processes, and I can almost not stop myself from trying to figure the book all out all at once.  Hopefully I’ll learn some patience one of these days; then I think the book will slowly communicate its message through meditation.  
I was drumming at church this morning, and I realized I would never try to ‘figure out’ what the meaning of drumming is.  Its merits lie in another realm of being beyond the analytical mind – sheer delight, joy and love of the rhythm, and the shared experience of making music.

John Michael Greer wrote, “As long as you realize that the striving never achieves its goal, that “who you aren’t” is at an infinite distance and so all your inevitable efforts in that direction will always fall short, it’s perfectly healthy.”
Children naturally act out dreams of being “who they aren’t” in the healthy process of discovering who they are. This week it’s an astronaut, tomorrow she’ll be a veterinarian, next month he’s a rock star, five minutes later they’re all Bedouin nomads. As a teacher of vey young children, I have long valued a distinction that our culture at large avoids – trying to be who you are not is a very healthy impulse, while trying not to be who you are is a deadening one. 
Like Fortune’s atoms, children pass through every potential trajectory in their environment, trying out being every possible way they are not. They accrete bits and pieces of every trajectory they try. Which bits end up clinging to them give them an unfolding glimpse into who they are, what their affinities are, and where they will eventually settle down into themselves. 
A healthy, balanced environment where the human cultures (family, school, religion, nation) line up with and aid understanding of the natural ecosystems (including the child’s own nature) ends up creating a large cosmos for the child to explore. An imbalanced environment where the human cultures are out of alignment with the natural ecosystems constrains the child to a small, impoverished cosmos with few possibilities. Our human cultures’ fears and denial of natural ecosystems require that we not be who we are, leaving little room to try being who we are not and discovering who we are. 
Faustian culture’s puritanical streak focuses intently on not being who we are – mortal, jealous, sexual. Faustian’s humanist streak focuses on being who we are not – immortal, altruistic, rational.  From inside the Faustian worldview, I have a difficult time imagining what just being who we are, in all our incompleteness, would look like. Maybe like atoms travelling along their path through all the circles despite being at home in one circle. Maybe like young children so very present in themselves while playing at being who they are not. Or maybe there is no way of separating being who we are from being who we aren’t.

I know I said I wouldn’t keep digging, but I’m Faustian, and so leaving stones un-turned is not in my nature. I also find it actually helping me to find peace with myself, so I think I’ll keep going and process later on.
I’m going to have to disagree with you/Spengler: I don’t think it’s the dream of infinite expansion that forms the core of Faustian thought. I think it’s linearity. The dream of infinite expansion comes out of it: it’s not expansion in all directions, but expansion along one direction. The infinite ego is the result of it as well: it’s the logical consequence of thinking of ego as the only thing that matters.
The multi-nested ironies around Faustian culture unfold from the fact that we are drawing lines on an elliptic space (like a sphere), to use a math reference (which is also very Faustian): they all, sooner or later, cross, and meet themselves, and since we focused on each line without worrying about anything else, where they meet it’s a mess.
The will to power is also a result of the dream of the line. A little power is a good thing, so more must be better. Of course, this also leads to negative results, but that’s hardwired into a system of thought that rejects whole system thinking.
Which, also logically flows from linearity. Whole systems are messy, not neat, and don’t give themselves over to a way of thinking based upon lines, so we are bad at whole systems thinking. I don’t mean as a culture, I mean every one of us is bad at it. It’s why we need to get training to do things people in other cultures find second nature.
The rejection of limits also unfolds from linearity. If the line is there, then it must be able to keep going off to infinity. The idea that something could possibly block it is unthinkable to us. The rejection of the distinction between want and is, so obvious in so many people’s identities, unfolds from the rejection of limits. 
Finally, the dream of expansion is the logical outgrowth of the line. The dream of the pursuit of the line further, and farther, than we already are, is a consequence of the line at the heart of our world.
One of the ironies that has occurred to me, is that since there’s only time to climb one mountain, a worldview obsessively focused on the one mountain you wish to climb is actually a benefit. As long as you recognize that other people could reasonably choose other mountains, I think it could actually be a very strong positive.
David,
Ah, and that’s exactly the kind of problem we have issues with: we have no way to resolve issues of conflicting rights. It does seem to cause us a lot of problems, and I’m far from sure there is any way to resolve the issue of freedom of speech vs decency in a Faustian worldview. Personally, I’m not even willing to try: I’m a free speech maximalist, which is probably a very Faustian view to take.
Phil,
Interesting that you consider being a military technology historian to be Faustian. I don’t find it to be very Faustian, truth be told. The technology is Faustian, but the interest in it seems less so. Then again, history in general is an obsession of our culture, much more so than most other cultures, so it might be. I’ll have to mull it over.

A few more notes:
First, I think the rage inherent in Faustian culture is a result of the universe, and self, not doing what its supposed to. Of course, the duality again means we can’t accept being angry without being angry people, and of course we all know someone like that, and we don’t want to be that person. So, we deny it. Thus our obsession with war technology, while screaming about how we hate war. 
Second, I think I’m having less luck figuring out positive aspects of Faustian culture because time hasn’t sorted out the gunk. I’m sure a thousand years from now, some of our literary, spiritual, cultural traditions will be known for having achieved greatness, but it’s hard to figure out which ones in the thick of things.
Third, I think it doesn’t matter if I identify the positive manifestations right now. I’m seeing the dangerous ones, and I’m seeing how they have impacted me (much more personal, so I’ll skip discussing it here), which has given me a great deal to work with regardless. Once I’m ready to build, instead of tearing down, I’ll need to think through the positives, but for now, it’s enough to start seeing the influences on my own life.

Re the mapping of the planes
It suddenly occurred to me this morning that our mapping of the planes, the Tree of Life, all the tools we have…these work with the cosmos not as it is in some absolute way, but rather as we perceive it.  Like how the constellations look as they do because of the vantage point from which we gaze, but would form completely different patterns if we stood on the surface of another planet circling a different star.  Everything we are doing here is from this relative position as human beings manifested as we are–our zero on the number line, as it were.

In general: wanted to note my appreciation (as is maybe seasonally appropriate) for these posts! They’re new enough to me that I mostly just read rather than having opinions, but I always enjoy them, and get a lot out of them.
@David, by the Lake: “Yes, the thing about optimization is that it is always with respect to a specific objective function (the thing to be optimized). Choose a different objective function, and the optimal solution—even with regard to the same set of constraints—will change accordingly.”
Yes! I was having a discussion in a LARP last weekend with a recently-created and morally dubious divine being (as one does) about whether caring about people is a “design flaw.” I pointed out that the definition of a “design flaw” depends on the intention of the design. 
This is also, IMO, something the social Darwinist bootstrap types fail to see–they substitute “evolution” for “design”, but evolution isn’t toward One Perfect Goal. It’s toward (and it’s not really directed, but I’m simplifying for the sake of argument like whoa, as the kids say) the best fit for your circumstances. (An octopus isn’t any better or worse-evolved than a falcon, but neither would do well in the other’s environment.) Adding to that, circumstances change all the time–a stegosaurus, for its era, was a triumph of evolution, and yet…
@Christophe: Totally agreed, and–perhaps naturally, because I like my hobbies–I think RPGs can serve a similarly useful function in adults. No, I will likely (and sadly) never be an elven mercenary leading armies, or a sun priestess with magic healing powers, but the experiences I have in those roles and what I enjoy about them can tell me a fair bit about what my own life maybe needs more of that I haven’t thought about: physical challenges or more leadership roles in the first case, maybe, or more community service and faith-centered activities in the second.
(Also, a personal semi-triumph in living closer to the fossil-fuel bone: brought up the notion of making future PA-ward trips on a bus to my father, and mentioned the environmental impact. He barely kicked at all, so I’ll be doing that in the future!)

@ Will J
Re free speech versus decency
I can’t disagree.  The perspective I’d take on that particular score, however, is one of appropriate roles.  Decency (or politeness or respect), I’d argue, is not the role of law.  Freedom of speech means allowing people to be bone-heads, rude, arrogant, and impolite — both in an”absolute” sense and in the sense that different people have different concepts of politeness.  (I can point to my own experience, having been raised in the South and now living in the Midwest.  These are very different worlds with very different standards.)  The role of law lay in protecting basic rights and minimizing harm, not insulating one from rudeness or injured feelings.  This is one area where I believe the social justice movement has gone to excess.  Mandating politeness is no more effective than legislating morality.
As to resolving conflicting rights, it comes down to negotiation and compromise, as messy and unsatisfactory as that may be to all sides.  What is that working definition of a good compromise? “A solution with which all parties are equally dissatisfied.”
@ isabelcooper & @ Christophe (if I may)
Re RPG and escapism
Exploring the world through role-play (like children do, for example) allows one to escape the bounds of one’s life in a way that cannot be done more conventionally.  Alas, I will never be so bold and daring (and insanely reckless) as my elven thief was during his brief but glorious existence, but I was able to experience the exhilaration of his death-defying chance-taking without putting my own well-being at risk.  I have the memories of those experiences in my imagination, certainly, and they have informed my life to some small degree.
Likewise, I’m rather looking forward to my new group’s upcoming Call of Cthulhu session, where I fully intend to gender-flip and play a Tommy-gun toting floozie…

I’ve been thinking of how Cosmic Doctrine applies to relationships and psychology. When someone strongly identifies a person or type of person as an enemy, it heavily influences one’s own mind and body. The hated one, the president as the most obvious example, becomes a sun in one’s mind. In a funny coincidence, he is glowing orange. How many billions of times a day is he thought of? 
I once had a bad roommate who I felt very angry about after I moved out. Even one year later, I was often thinking angrily about her. That hurt me a lot, and it wasn’t hurting her at all (as far as I know). I realized this was injuring my Heart with no purpose. I learned from my Qi Gong teacher to meditate on a specific bad memory and notice where I felt unpleasantness in my body. And then, to not let my mind wander and focus neutrally on the memory and breathe the bad energy out of my body. This really worked for me. I let it go. Now when I run into her, my heart doesn’t race, I feel neutral.  This has also worked on bad childhood memories. 
I think PTSD could be thought of in this way. Someone has a trauma, so bad that they can’t even think about it without freaking out. So they do everything they can to not think of it. Then it becomes a black sun in the center of their psyche that everything else revolves around.
It’s funny, I read this chapter a few months ago and when I re-read it this time, it wasn’t familiar at all. I think it was so hard for me to understand, I was day-dreaming through it. Now I’m able to read a few pages before drifting off. 🙂

Hi John Michael,
Thanks! 🙂
Not to butt in on a point made above, but I read Mr Kunstler’s most recent blog essay this morning and I also note the observation made in the comments above: “The insistence that everyone is immersed in a toxic worldview is equally defensive in its effect, since it blocks criticism of the ideology according to which worldviews are judged to be toxic.”
There are parallels between the two discussions, and I have a dark suspicion that the entire point of the argument – and it is an argument with no end in sight – is to tie a person up through the use of a logical fallacy. The presentation of an argument can sometimes be used to sap energy.
Being tied up generally means that for the person involved that they are less free to get on with other more pressing matters! Dunno, just my twenty cents.
In the past I’ve made the error of pouring energy into a discussion, and sometimes those discussions are like black holes and they’ll consume everything – and who knows what becomes of energy sucked into a black hole?
Cheers
Chris

Re motion and rest
An interesting point on the cycles of action and stillness as I reflect on another episode in the saga that is local politics.  Last night, our city council took an action that is likely to have kicked the hornet’s nest good and proper, roiling a rather vocal contingent of the local population, yet was most certainly a prudent course of action (to be fair, it was not a unanimous vote).  However, while we are more responding to (needless) escalations by another party, the broader context involves issues about which we cannot speak for the time being.  So we have to sit by and take our lumps in social media while “the other side” broadcasts its version of the story and vilifies our city staff.  (It will be interesting to see if my name gets mixed up in all this, as I was the one who ended up making the motion last night, which is public record.  It helps, I suppose, that I’m not on FacePalm or Twit.)  The truth will out–eventually–but it is fascinating to see an application of the rather obtuse reading for this month so directly.
Re Faustian worldview
I can’t find the link just now, but was glancing through a brief article on CEO sentiment souring on the economy and caught mention of a reference to (Fed Chair) Powell’s opinion that “economic expansion can continue indefinitely.”  If that ain’t Faustian (and horribly, horribly mistaken), I’m not sure what is! 🙂







 Will J says: 



								November 20, 2018 at 9:45 am							




I think I’ve found a very useful aspect of Faustian culture: there’s a burning desire, a need, to change things. It usually gets buried under the idea that we are already perfect, and the contradiction between thinking that you’re already being what you want to be, and a strong need to change is unhealthy, and I think a major driving force in the collective insanity right now, but if you acknowledge that you aren’t there yet, the desire to change could be very useful, if guided in the right direction.

@JMG and Sara Dee – just dipping a toe lightly back in here… 
“What I’m challenging is the rhetorical game that conflates privilege with prejudice, and insists that if you’ve got the one you must necessarily have, and thus can be blamed for, the other. In the real world, by contrast, you can have privilege without prejudice, and you can also have prejudice without privilege; furthermore, neither you nor I nor anyone else can change our condition of privilege, but we can certainly learn to dispense with our prejudices [if we are prepared to see and own them, first].”
Re the bit I’ve added, that is to say, while I am completely on board with this entire paragraph, the bit that I found exciting in your original comment, was the implication that “to learn to dispense with[prejudice]” begins with the process of “accept[ing] it”.    Prejudices (as opposed to privileges) are actually a very normal part of our mental furnishings, mainly because in relation to peoples we are not acquainted with, we necessarily take shortcuts and categorise our absence of knowledge about them under easy to remember symbols (eg. Irish, leprechaun, Irish, alcohol-drinking).  Such stereotypes are convenient ways to categorise huge amounts of information we have no way to directly access, about people who are distant.  Some of the shortcuts that create stereotypes are cultural, and get arranged within our heads as mental furniture long before we have a chance to choose our own furnishing style.
Anyway, I want to thank you, JMG for offering the thought (arising from the two separate quotes, put together) that if we learn to accept them, we have some chance of learning to dispense with our prejudices.
Sara Dee, thank you, also.  For several interesting thoughts. 
As to KKA’s point: “I’m taking very seriously the possibility that the purpose of my life is not just to transcend material reality, but to live it to the concrete, fleshly, worldly max.”  I tend also to be of that persuasion.  That the world is here to be lived and loved, and whatever lies ahead or behind, right here, right now, is the place where I AM, and whatever there is to experience here, is what needs to be drunk to the fullest by me.  
I am reading and perusing the Cosmic Doctrine, but in the presence of many, many thoughtful comments, I am currently, mostly, awed.  So to all of you, know that I lurk, and listen, and I enjoy.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Evolution of a Solar System 
December 12, 2018John Michael Greer60 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 7, “The Evolution of a Solar System,” pp. 35-38.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 6, “Cosmic Influences upon a Solar System,” pp. 49-54.
Commentary:
At this point we’ve completed the first six chapters (or five, if you’re using the Millennium Edition) and the first six months of work with The Cosmic Doctrine. Those readers who are still following along have put in six months of heavy philosophical lifting, learning to make sense of the magical vision of the Cosmos as expressed to the nearest approximate metaphor.  The basic structures and concepts of Fortune’s symbolic philosophy have all been set out in emblematic form, and what follows will draw on symbols and metaphors a little easier to relate to the world as we experience it.
It’s important to keep the Cosmic background in mind as we go on, though, and there are two reasons for that. First of all, a solar system in its structure and evolution reflects the Cosmos that gave birth to it. Each of the stages of the process of Cosmic evolution we’ve discussed over the last six months has its equivalent in the stages of evolution that a solar system follows in turn. The stages are equivalent rather than identical, since each solar system starts out in a complex, intricately structured Cosmos rather than in a vast emptiness representing the Unmanifest. Still, as we proceed, it will be simple enough to point out how the evolutionary phases of the Cosmos are mirrored in the evolution of the solar system.
The second reason is that solar systems aren’t isolated from the Cosmos. Beings within a solar system are influenced by factors internal to that system, but influences from without still have a secondary role. It’s a subtle role—it works primarily by way of the influence of Cosmic processes on the Solar Logos, the Great Organism at the center of a solar system, and secondarily by way of the Star Logoi, who come into being within the solar system and will be discussed later—but it has its effect. The great phases of expansion and contraction driven by the movement of the Ring-Cosmos relative to the Ring-Chaos, the influence of the twelve great Rays as they stream out from the Central Sun to act on each of the seven Cosmic Planes, and the influence of Great Organisms and their solar systems on one another, are thus all significant in the life of a solar system. It’s by being aware of these factors that we can understand some of the oddities in our own collective evolution.
Since it’s crucial to recall the Cosmic context as we proceed, this chapter is a recapitulation of the material covered in the previous chapters, with a few additional notes of interest. It sums up the genesis of the Cosmos from the first flowing movement in empty space to the establishment of solar systems on the seven Cosmic Planes. From here on in we’re going to be talking about the evolution of one particular solar system—the one you and I happen to inhabit, one of countless solar systems to be found on the seventh Cosmic Plane.
One of the things stressed in this recapitulation is the role of numbers in this philosophy. Motion in space—the basis for the whole system—is represented by the number one. The great cosmic forces—the Rings, the Rays, and the Circles or planes—are represented by the numbers three, twelve, and seven respectively. These four numbers are the Primaries. Each of the Circles collects atoms whose orbits have a particular geometry, and thus a particular number—the three-sided atomic orbits settle out on the first plane, the four-sided on the second plane, and so on out to the seventh plane, where the atoms have nine-sided orbits. The numbers three through nine inclusive are therefore the Secondaries. Finally, the number ten is the Prime Tertiary, the number that guides and shapes evolution once the Primaries and Secondaries are in place.
Those readers who know their way around traditional occult philosophy will recognize these numbers at once. The numbers of the great cosmic forces, three and twelve and seven, added together make 22, the number of the paths of the Cabalistic Tree of Life; ten, of course, is the number of spheres in the Tree of Life. It’s more common in occult philosophies to make ten the primary number and twenty-two dependent on it, but Fortune’s making a specific point here. Her Cosmos of metaphors is made entirely of motion in space, and so she makes the paths, the currents of moving force on the Tree, primary; the spheres, which in one sense are stages of spiritual unfoldment, are dependent on the soul’s movement along the paths.
The secondaries also have their importance in occult philosophy, but they do so individually rather than collectively. If you add them together you get 42; this will doubtless delight Douglas Adam fans, but the number 42 has only a modest role in occult symbolism. The numbers three through nine are the numbers of the great planetary forces, from Saturn (which has a threefold symbolism and a magic square of three times three cells) to the Moon (which has a ninefold symbolism and a magic square of nine times nine cells). One, finally, is the number of divinity and, in a solar system, represents the influence of the god of that solar system, the Great Organism who, as the solar system is born, becomes its Solar Logos.
Notice that two numbers have obviously been left out of these categories: the numbers two and eleven. There is of course nothing in the least accidental about this exclusion. Two is the number of negative evil, the force of inertia or resistance against which every other force in the Cosmos and the solar system alike must test its strength. As a number, it represents nothing internal to the Cosmos or the solar system—it represents, rather, the background against which the Cosmos and the solar system unfold their possibilities.
Eleven, by contrast, is in occult tradition the number of positive evil. We haven’t talked much about that so far, and quite a few more chapters will have to be studied and understood before Fortune’s way of talking about positive evil will make sense. For now, think of it as the refusal of evolution, where negative evil is the resistance to evolution. While positive evil certainly exists in our solar system, it’s not a necessary part of things. It comes into being as a result of unforced choices on the part of individual beings, and thus it’s conceivable that there might be some solar system somewhere in the Cosmos where none of the individual beings happened to make those choices, where negative evil was a reality but positive evil remained a theoretical possibility and nothing more.
These numbers, therefore, provide the framework for the new solar system. The Great Organism at its core started off with a tenfold structure, and then developed reactions corresponding to each of the other numbers in the course of its journeys up and down the twelve Rays of the Cosmos as a traveling atom. It then continues to respond to each of the forces represented by these numbers as it settles into place on its plane with its cloud of static atoms around it. This is the basis for what Fortune calls sidereal astrology.
In some ways, that’s an unfortunate label, since it has also been taken up by a school of astrology that uses the constellations rather than the equinoctial and solstitial points to set out the wheel of the zodiac. Still, there’s a connection. The tropical zodiac—that’s the technical term for the zodiac used in classic Western astrology, in which the sign Aries starts at the point where the Sun is at the moment of the spring equinox—is based on factors entirely internal to our solar system. The sidereal zodiac tries to take into account forces from outside the solar system, and what Fortune calls sidereal astrology is all about those outside forces. The influence of those forces shifts over vast intervals of time, and can be tracked by a number of means, starting with the precession of the equinoxes.
History offers interesting reflections of what Fortune is saying here. It’s an interesting detail of the history of astrology, for example, that in the early days of Western astrology, when it was practiced by astronomer-priests standing on mud-brick ziggurats along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Venus was a planet of war as well as love. Recently deciphered Mayan inscriptions show similarly that the movements of Venus were used in Mesoamerican astrology to choose good times to declare war and to predict victory in battle.
I don’t know of any astrologer at present who would try to read placements of Venus with that in mind, since that’s not the way the energies of Venus influence people’s lives today. The most likely explanation for the difference is that the energies have changed over the last several thousand years—that the Cosmic influences flowing in from the fifth Cosmic plane, and brought into focus in our solar system by way of the planet Venus, have shifted over time, downplaying the violent aspect of Venerean passions and amplifying the gentler aspects.
Keep in mind, though, that these changes are in some sense cumulative. In the chapters we’ve already studied, a central theme is that the changes set in motion by one phase of Cosmic evolution become the foundation on which the next phase of Cosmic evolution builds.  This same principle remains in effect as we move into the evolution of the solar system, and also as we go from there to the evolution of individual beings within the solar system. Our text summarizes this in a crisp phrase: “you start where God leaves off.”  You come into the world, in other words, with the entire past of the Cosmos implicit in you, and then you add to it by your own actions. Those actions are directed by something that usually gets called “free will,” though Fortune notes that this is an unhelpful label for it; her own label—epigenesis—will take quite a bit of explanation as we go further.
There is more going on here than unforced choices in an otherwise deterministic Cosmos, though. Fortune asks us to imagine our solar system in its formative stages, as the Great Organism who will become its Solar Logos sweeps outward from the center all the way to the seventh Cosmic Plane, gathering up as many of the static atoms of each plane as it can draw with it by a metaphoric equivalent of gravitational attraction.  Once it reaches the seventh Circle it settles into its orbit, and the static atoms it brought with it sort themselves out into great belts of Cosmic atoms of different kinds, each belt consisting of atoms of one kind, orbiting the Solar Logos at a distance set by its (metaphoric) density. As the Logos and its attendant atomic belts sweep around the vast arc of the seventh Circle, they pass through each of the Rays in turn. All this is perfectly orderly.
At the same time, something much less orderly is also going on. All the other Circles are also full of solar systems of their own, which differ from ours in that they lack static atoms from the seventh Circle, the Circle that corresponds to the plane of physical matter. Those other solar systems move at different speeds, and as they swing close to our solar system, their influence affects the atoms in our solar system that come from the plane where the passing solar system exists. If a solar system on the sixth Circle swings past, all the atoms in our solar system with eight-sided orbits will be affected; think of it as gravity, first pulling the eight-sided atoms back along the track of our solar system’s orbit, then pulling them in toward the Central Sun, and then pulling them forward as the sixth-plane solar system speeds past ours.
The same is true, in turn, of atoms in our solar system with three-sided orbits whenever a solar system of the first Cosmic Plane swings past. As the solar system proceeds with its evolution, in other words, it’s constantly being pulled and pushed and buffeted in complicated ways by the influence of other solar systems on the Circles further in. As we’ll see, this makes things challenging for the Solar Logos, and also for the individual beings who arise within the solar system and pass through their evolution there.
One measure of that complexity can be judged from one of Fortune’s passing remarks in the revised edition. Since it’s not in the Millennium Edition, I’ll quote it in full:
“You can see that there are times when the Lower Astral would receive a stimulus and times when the Upper Spiritual would likewise, although this is not so strong as the corresponding Cosmic plane is not so near. This is one of the things that check evolution and often set up trouble in a system.”
This may take some unpacking. Here, as she usually does, Fortune is using a taxonomy of the planes of being which identifies seven planes: upper spiritual, lower spiritual, upper mental, lower mental, upper astral, lower astral, and physical/etheric. These exist on our plane, the seventh Cosmic Plane, but all of them but the last also reflect the influence of one of the other Cosmic Planes—thus the upper spiritual plane reflects the influence of the first Cosmic Plane, the lower spiritual plane that of the second, and so on. Since each of us exists on every plane from the physical to the upper spiritual, we are subject to influences from outside our solar system whenever a solar system on one of the higher Cosmic Planes. When human beings act collectively in very strange ways, this can be one of the causes.
We’ll be exploring those complexities further as this series of posts proceeds. For the time being, it’s most important to get a clear sense of the way that the opening phases of solar evolution unfold. The last two paragraphs of our chapter sketch out the emerging solar system in a clear visual image, which is meant to remind you of the corresponding stages in the emergence of the Cosmos. Take the time to build up that image in your imagination; from it, a great deal will unfold as we proceed.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted—and as most of you will already have found out!—The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on January 9. Until then, have at it!

JMG, on Sunday our local fishwrap reprinted an article from the Columbus, Ohio, Dispatch on that city’s Druid group.  The article was friendly to the Druids.  If you’d like to read it and can’t find it on the Internet, e-mail me your address and I’ll send you the article.

John–
As usual, this will require considerable reflection and re(re)reading of the text, but two things that leapt out at me:
First, the inversion of primacy which Fortune introduces with respect to the paths and sephiroth (or at least, implies via the numbers she’s working with) instantly made me think of the inversion which George Adams discusses in <Physical and Ethereal Spaces with respect to the New Geometry: that is, in the etheric space, it is not a line that is made up points along it, or a plane made up of lines within it, but rather it is the line that is constructed by the intersection of planes and the point that is composed of the intersecting lines.
It also brings to mind the notion of dual spaces and dual problems in certain branches of mathematics, but that is just my translator at work again 🙂
Secondly, the point regarding the number two as signifying negative evil (“resistance”), of course, immediately brought to mind the Contending Forces of Thaumiel.  I thought it interesting that the first of the Qliphoth would be thus associated with negative, rather than positive, evil.  Is that consistent with broader occult understanding or just happenstance of the numbers involved?

Just a quick aside, something that clicked after reading the first few paragraphs.  We’re often encouraged to have as many experiences in life as possible, many say so that we have an open mind.  It seems actually more useful because we have then had more possible metaphors to correlate with, which has given us more options to see possible consequences.  For me, that realization alone is much more meaningful than simply having a more open mind.  And it makes a lot more sense as I realize most of my thoughts follow the paths created by prior experiences.

Yesterday (Tues., Dec. 11) NASA posted a photo on The Astronomy Picture of the Day website that beautifully depicts what happens when two Great Organisms (galaxies at NASA) interact with each other, and how the matter of each is strongly affected. It seems an interesting synchronicity  that the photo was shown one day before our discussion from the Cosmic Doctrine of this same topic on how our Solar System (a Great Organism) interacts with other Solar Systems as she rotates around the seventh Plane. The image gives a nice visual on how This is one of the things that check evolution and often set up trouble in a system. The photo may be found here.

Pogonip, thanks for the heads up. I assume this is the article? 
David, it’s quite consistent with the broader tradition. Negative evil is basic; positive evil is derived from it. 
Prizm, an excellent point! 
Dan, thanks for this. A galaxy is a collection of Great Organisms, but the image is still a gorgeous one.

I have to keep telling myself, “Its only a metaphor… Its only a metaphor,” because I keep running into examples that are very much like Fortune’s CosDoc–
For example, in a Chemistry Journal Paper from 2013 (Boeyens JCA, Levendis DC.  All is Number. Struct Bond 2013; 148: 162-178), the authors comment on the mysterious ‘Ho Tu Numbers,’ and how their patterns (which look a lot like Fortune’s metaphorical atoms) not only are a good description of the structures and linkages of DNA base pairs, but also form the basis from which the I Ching was developed.  All this appeared in China 4000 years ago. 
You can read the two pages and further comments on my blog, on the 12 Dec 2018 posting, here;
http://jackmanassas.blogspot.com/
One of their sources, Katya Walter, describes a double-bubble universe model that really does read a lot like the Cos Doc, here;  https://www.katyawalter.com/ 
JMG, have you run across the Ho Tu numbers, and if so, any comment on their relationship with the Cos Doc metaphor?

John –
If I’m understanding you and Fortune correctly, the numbers 3 and 7 are both Primaries and Secondaries. Is there any deeper significance to that?







 Bruno Bolzon says: 



								December 13, 2018 at 5:40 am							




JMG, is there any connection between positive/negative evil and /Ahrimanic/Luciferic evil?

All of this reminds me of Iamblichus’ Theology of Arithmetic very much. Mouravieff’s Gnosis has some similar teachings on the Three Rays and the Seven Notes and the Twelve Worlds, etc. etc. Fascinating stuff, particularly once the realization is made that physical life doesn’t make sense on its own terms (in one sense): everything dies. This leads to the suspicion that whatever ordered whole is at work, works “secretly”, but yet “in the open” too, that is, each plane is inviolate in integrity, even lowest ones, but analogically “reflects” or mirrors or hints at the one above it. One of the most hopeful comments I ever read (in shedding my reductionistic tendencies) was in Scott Buchanan’s Doctrine of Signatures – he said that modern science builds its world by looking for analogies A:B::C:D, and then once they are found, shoves all the discoveries on the same side of the colon, and goes looking for more, without ever bothering studying the structure of the analogy itself, and assuming that everything on that side of the balance (the grab bag of “discoveries”) is dead matter in empty space. I find myself constantly “thinking in terms” of reductionistic science – it is definitely “in the air”, and a real effort has to be made to become free from it. Thanks for the post.

James, thanks for the tour through this fascinating book, although it is a pretty heavy read.
The galaxy or the Earth described as a living thing always fascinated me.
Something resonated, when I first read this notion in Isaak Asimov’s foundation saga (book #4) describing the galaxy as alive.
The most profound experience I had on a flight back from Australia reading Lovelock’s book Gaia.
Having seen the world largest living being the Great Barrier Reef first hand while diving I was aware that living beings can be much greater than I thought.
I read the book “Gaia” on the plane and then looked outside the window just watching the sun set and again something resonated.
It just felt true that the Earth itself is a living being.
Thus I am open to further dive into this train of thought.
Thanks again for the guided tour.

John–
Just so that I’m seeing that last set of metaphors correctly: the system settling in the seventh plane exists in the sub-planes simultaneously, these being themselves metaphors for the linkages back to the interior planes, and these linkages are manifested in the influences on the corresponding atoms of appropriate angularity.  Is the Logos at the center of that system on the seventh plane under any direct influence or are the influences on the solar system under development restricted to the pushing and pulling on its orbiting atoms?
(And I’m admittedly curious about the off-list response.  I can’t imagine anyone caring that a group of folks in a remote corner of the internet are discussing an obscure work that most people have never heard of–certainly not enough to evoke the kind of incivility and language that gets one banned from here.)

JMG
This last week the ‘Coriolis effect’ made its way into my thinking. This is called “the fictional force” because the effects described, for example weather systems spinning east across the North Atlantic, can be calculated as if they are directed by a force. Sure there are ‘forces’ at the back of this, but what we see, if I understand correctly, is displacement due to movements in space.  Thus ‘Coriolis’ seems to me a good metaphor, perhaps apposite to this DF discussion. I guess all our metaphors can be described as ‘fiction’, but with results that are real enough?
I find myself spinning off into thoughts of the reality of ‘will’ (Schopenhauer, and much past discussion hereabouts). How come we get an ‘informed will’, especially an ‘informed will’ which in human form relies heavily on our language facility and the real powers coming from metaphor? Somewhere there we might find ‘astrology’ and ‘fictional forces’ apparent in those calculations and workings – together with real results? But all that is for me another story and I am not expecting any great resolution just now. Smile.

PS If I may; leftover from last week I found too late this quote from Yeats definition of poetry, “ the traditional expression of certain heroic and religious themes, passed on from age to age, modified by individual genius, but never abandoned.” Hmm…

We experience many cycles in our lives, from the Cosmic Doctrine the main ones seem to be the cycles of 12, 7, and 4. There are two possible ways to experience the cycle of 12, by traveling the circuit of the 12 Rays and by rotating once around the Central Stillness in a specific Plane. Since our solar system is rotating around the seventh Plane, it seems the 12 months of the year represents a cycle of this rotation. It is tempting to place a longer cycle of 12, such as the precession of the equinoxes into the longer cycle of 12, traveling the circuit of the 12 Rays. There is also an approximate cycle of 12 full moons in a year that may be in some way related to one of these cycles of 12.
We have a number of cycles of 7 in our lives, both weekly and 7-year cycles. Both of these cycles of 7 repeat in a well defined order of influences: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. The only way I can think of experiencing the cycle of 7 in this fashion from the cosmology of the Cosmic Doctrine is by traveling the cycle of 12 Rays and passing through each of the 7 Planes in an orderly fashion. If this is true, it would mean that humanity is still evolving as traveling atoms. Maybe the next goal of our evolution is to reach a state of equilibrium on whatever Plane our individual prime atom’s geometry places it.

I suppose I’m falling into the trap of being very literal here, but how do solar systems in the inner circles swing close by the seventh circle, given that there can be up to five circles in between?
Is it the case that solar systems in the sixth circle will be problematic more often than those in the first circle, due to their proximity?

The part about all things following the laws of their own nature reminds me of one law for the ox and the lion being oppression. As I understand it, there are cosmic laws that all things follow, but where that leaves off, things follow laws of their own nature? It strikes me that the reason classical Newtonian physics works so well until you get into the situations that Einstein was discussing, or you start dealing with black holes, or other specialized physics were even relativity doesn’t work perfectly, is because Newton’s laws both contain the universal but also the laws of the seventh plane of the seventh circle, whereas something like light would have a different nature than dense matter and therefore behave a little differently in certain circumstances. Is that why a unified field theory of everything is a ring out of reach from the materialist merrygoround?

E. Goldstein, fascinating! Yes, I’m familiar (slightly) with the Ho T’u magic square, but hadn’t thought of correlating it with the Cos.Doc. — and it astonishes me that an article on Taoist numerology got past the peer reviewers. (Not that there’s anything wrong with Taoist numerology — au contraire, it makes a lot more sense than some current sciences, and isn’t in the middle of a replicability crisis — but scientists used to be rigidly opposed to anything like that.)
Sass, yes, there is. It’s a source of much complexity in making sense of occult symbolism — when you get a three or a seven, are you dealing with the secondary planetary energy, or are you dealing with an emblem of the whole system? That said, why Saturn and Venus should be more symbols of the whole than any other planetary energy makes a good theme for meditation. 
Bruno, good! No, Ahrimanic and Luciferic evil are the two opposing forms of positive evil. 
Argus, it should! The entire Western tradition of occult numerology has its roots in the Pythagorean traditions Iamblichus gathered so systematically, and if you know your number lore you’ll find its traces all through Western spirituality. 
B3rnhard, that sounds like quite an experience. Remember that in the magical view of things, all things are alive; life isn’t an odd chemical phenomenon present in a few material objects, it’s a force that flows and surges through all things and is simply more manifest in some than in others. In a very real sense, we all live one life. 
David, yes, that’s basically it. The Logos is influenced by the great phases of the Rings and by the Rays through which it passes on its orbit, but not by other solar systems. As for the troll, I get that particular sort from time to time — he seemed to think that all he had to do was yell at me, and I’d stop writing about occultism and go back to writing about the subjects I covered in the Archdruid Report. I’d have put the comment through and made fun of him if he’d left out the profanity. 
Phil H, hmm! I like that metaphor — and also the Yeats quote, of course. 
Dan, good. We’ll get into the place of individual beings such as you and me in later chapters, and at that point the source of the sevenfold rhythm should be clearer. 
Kay, nope — I made the chart myself, precisely because neither edition includes anything of the kind. The Cos.Doc. really benefits from explanatory graphics! 
Phil, that’s one of the places where the metaphor has to be stretched a bit. Yes, sixth-circle systems have more of an effect on our system than first-circle systems, and indeed our text says so — you’ll just have to imagine that first-circle systems can still have some effect despite the distance.
Kyle, yes, exactly!

“in the early days of Western astrology, when it was practiced by astronomer-priests standing on mud-brick ziggurats along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Venus was a planet of war as well as love.”
Gerda Lerner’s The Evolution of Patriarchy chronicles the diminishing status of women in early Mesopotamian state societies and correlates it with the typically-later diminishing status of goddesses, followed of course by their obliteration.  Ishtar was originally a warrior goddess, sometimes portrayed with armor and weapons.  As Babylonian and related cultures became more patriarchal, Ishtar became “domesticated” and was no longer portrayed so.  Therefore, her planet would no longer have been seen as representing war.

I look forward to these posts each month. Like you said, reading and meditating on the text can be heavy lifting, and often I find it tedious. But you warned us about that ahead of time, so I’ve continued slogging.
When a new chapter comes into view, and with it a sense that we are GOING somewhere on this strange journey of the imagination, then I get excited again and want to keep building the image in my mind, walking around inside it, wondering about it, keeping it there at the edges of my awareness when I’m going about my day.
No grand leaps of consciousness yet for me as a result of meditating discursively on The Cosmic Doctrine, but I take it that’s not really the point of this component of occult study.

Regarding the influence of the other Great Organisms and atoms in other planes on our solar system in the seventh plane, she notes that they travel at different speeds on the different planes. Using the metaphorical shape of the concentric rings, I assume things in the first plane are orbiting both extremely fast and extremely close together (in a smaller space) relative to the much vaster seventh plane. Given their smaller number of angles, they are also very small.
I picture that the influence in terms of frequency,  strength and distinctness of source of each plane’s habitants on the solar system in the seventh sphere thus ranges from relatively Nearly Constant But Weak and Unidentifiable/omnidirectional from the first plane; to Infrequent, Strong, and Identifiable/unidirectional from the sixth.

First, a question. What is your sense/belief of our sun as a being?
Second, I’ve lately become interested, besides electric universe, in Saturn Sun theory, which is the idea, (much like Velikovsky’s stuff) that earth was captured by our current sun but used to live beneath Saturn as a brown dwarf, and that when this transfer happened, Venus and Mars became destabilized. This would explain why Venus was once considered a goddess of war – because in the extreme electromagnetic upheavals which occurred, Venus appeared to attack Mars. Mars lost, because it is smaller. Apparently the Odyssey is full of the Venus and Mars war. 
Third, I think human beings are acting collectively in very strange ways of late.

I’ve been following these posts from the start and am finding the journey fascinating. I also begin to see what DF means by the CD training the mind rather than informing it. 
For instance, I don’t know if you’ve been following what’s been going on with the “yellow vests” in France. Basically, their president, Macron, has been working hard to give tax breaks to the rich, while making the middle classes pay for the costs of fighting climate change through increased taxes. Go figure! Anyways, finally the people have had enough and are demonstrating against Macron, wearing their yellow safety vests everyone is obligated to have in their cars. Here is a very good essay on the situation: https://roarmag.org/essays/gilets-jaunes-blown-old-political-categories/
The point is that when I was reading that articlle, the patterns described in the CD kept jumping out at me. Macron seems to be making all the classic mistakes by trying to smash the movement, which just seems to make it stronger. The yellow vests are not structured by any organization, but the pushback from the government seems to be crystallizing groups among them with specific interests and goals. All this seems to fit perfectly with the CD.
Then I stumbled across a very different article that is about systems theory. Now, I don’t have any training in that field, so I found it quite tough going until it all started to sound so familiar because of the CD. Here’s the last sentence of the abstract, “…while closed systems collapse into disorder, systems open to a structured environment spontaneously generate order.” That really seemed to resonate with the ideas expressed in the book. Here’s the link to the full article:

@JMG re: Ho Tu Numbers
I don’t think we can call it a _complete_ win for Scientific recognition of Taoist Numerology–
The authors of that article were primarily interested in giving more evidence for their 4-dimensional model of Chemistry.  For completeness, they pointed out that the Ho Tu numbers not only give an accurate representation of DNA within their 4-D chemistry model, but may have additional insights to offer genetics that no one currently understands.
I originally wanted to post a link to the Ho Tu diagram in the article, and I can usually get a good image from the image listings in http://www.researchgate.net — But in this case, their image listing did not include the Ho Tu diagram.  I had to pull the paper copy of the Journal and manually scan it myself to put it into my blog.
Sometimes you have to go beyond the internet to get the whole picture. 😉

I got to thinking in a pretty general way about how the idea of the different Numbers conveys the concept that the Cosmos has various forces or Laws at work– things are not just all happening at random. It’s a fairly orderly and organized place.  That leads to the thought that it didn’t just somehow come into being of its own accord, but is the product of an intelligent mind of some sort.  It came from one and became many.  It reminded me of Dion Fortune’s name (or pseudonym, at least) which I believe was intended to mean “God, not luck.”
Considering the statement that ‘The Cosmos is the framework upon which all is built up:” this makes me think of the causes that lie behind the events we experience.  I have a feeling many people think that, to a large extent, they themselves are the causes of the things that take place in their lives.  But it’s not really that way. Although we have a degree of free will, we’re far down on the totem pole of causation.  Most of the causes happen on planes beyond the material one we normally experience.  Many of the events we experience happen because of this organized framework or Cosmic Laws – the way the Cosmos was created and operates.  So there are many outside influences which direct and limit our actions, which is I suppose why the various methods of divination, including astrology, work.  
The traveling atom which becomes the sun of our solar system, having passed through the process of evolution, has experienced all the cosmic influences.  Contemplating the final image of it settling down into a spinning disc, in the same way that the original Cosmos came into being, implies that it itself then will cause a new system to come into being, in the fractal way you described a while back.  So it then becomes possible for it to be a cause of events.

Kay, thank you! I’m glad to hear it. 
Dewey, which one of those was the cause, and which the effect? If you take spirituality seriously, it seems to me, it doesn’t really work to make changes in the status of the gods depend on human economic and political shifts…
Dylan, great leaps of consciousness are overrated. It’s the step by step expansion of your ability to think clearly and understand the symbolic language of occultism that really does the heavy lifting. 
SaraDee, that’s certainly a workable interpretation. 
Onething, 1) I consider the Solar Logos to be a real being, the reality behind the sun gods of traditional polytheist faith. 2) Hmm — interesting. 3) Yes, that was what I was hinting at!
Reloaded15, excellent! Yes on both counts. 
Onething, yes, and quite possibly.

Re evolution
In our discussions of this work, we’ve talked about evolution–in particular, evolution in the sense of action, reaction, and tendency towards greater and greater complexity.  And we’ve framed “evil” (both negative and positive) as an opposition to that evolution.  Elsewhere, however, we’ve discussed evolution as being something directionless, as only a response to changing conditions, rather than an inevitable progress towards some distant goal.
If evolution is directionless in that sense, even on the cosmic level, then that brings up a host of questions.  (And if it isn’t, why the difference between cosmic evolution and the other kind?)
Is “evil” as opposition to evolution actually evil in the sense we think of the word?  Is all change or increased complexity necessarily “good”?  If complexity has limits (and the point of the dance is truly itself), then does there not have to be a devolutionary stage to the cosmic cycle in which the complexity is reduced and the systems ultimately resolve back into the Unmanifest?  (As an inexact analogy, I think of the wheel of samsara in which even the gods are trapped, falling in their due time.)
If the cosmic dance doesn’t have a devolutionary stage but consists of continuous evolution and increasing complexity, or in the alternative, growth to a point and then perpetual stasis thereafter, how does it differ from the narratives of Progress or the Eternal Now of the Faustian and Magian cultures?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								December 14, 2018 at 1:02 pm							




David, good! That’s one of the reflections this sort of thing is meant to encourage. Human beings are way too fond of overinflating their importance in the overall scheme of things — and after all, we basically are paramecia squabbling in the thin damp film covering the surface of a rock in space. 
As for the trolls, basically, yes. I get that kind of thing from time to time, roll my eyes, and keep on writing about what I want to write about. 
Y. Chireau, Fortune’s school did quite a bit of work with a wide range of angels — most Western mystery schools do. In her teachings, the Solar Logos — who could as well be called the Solar Angel, if you prefer that term — is the patron deity of every living being in the solar system, our species very much included. I’m not familiar with the Manasaputra — can you point me to a good translation or source? 
David, excellent. There is indeed a devolutionary stage. Remember that the overall rhythm of the Cosmos is set by the rotation of the Ring-Cosmos relative to the Ring-Chaos, and so you get alternating phases: a phase in which old forms are broken up so that new forms can be established, followed and preceded by a phase in which existing forms settle into place and establish themselves. So a form evolves during one period when the Ring-Cosmos is moving toward the Ring-Chaos, settles into stability when the Ring-Cosmos moves away from the Ring-Chaos, and then at some subsequent turn toward the Ring-Chaos, devolves and gives way to some other form. 
So it’s not just a matter of ever-increasing complexity. There’s a balance between growth and dissolution at every level of the Cosmos.

@JMG: “Dewey, which one of those was the cause, and which the effect? If you take spirituality seriously, it seems to me, it doesn’t really work to make changes in the status of the gods depend on human economic and political shifts…”
Since the increased subordination of women preceded the portrayal of goddesses as subordinate,  it doesn’t really work to make the latter the cause of the former.  (I suppose you would actually have to say that the increasing power of male deities somehow caused male humans to become more patriarchal, which doesn’t say much for human capacities or worth – but still there’s a cause and effect problem.)  
Besides, views of divinities can change far faster than entities with which the names are associated could plausibly be changing – e.g., when you look at all the different portrayals of “Jesus” just in Western Christianity, it is evident that men are making God in their own image, and no change in the “status of Jesus” should be assumed.  If I assume that when Ishtar stopped being portrayed in armor, it was because the entity known by that name had become weak and passive, then should I also assume that when she stopped being portrayed at all, it was because she had ceased to exist?

Archdruid,
I’ve been thinking about resistances and creation. I remember an old friend once told me their proudest moment from their childhood was during a moment in a play where their partner forgot his line, and my friend had to improvise on the spot. That bit of improvisation was so good that play’s director congratulated my friend and made them take a special bow at the end of the play. For all points of creativity and improvisation there exists structure. That is to say that a specific limitation which a person can use as thrust block to progress in a new direction. A general with a strategy can take advantage of the range of tactical possibilities within the scope of their own strategy and their enemies strategy. Similarly an actor on a stage can improvise only if they have a script with a direction, a path to follow through space. 
In politics negative evil occurs when an ideology acts as a thrust-block to another ideology, and allows something new (usually a law or policy) to be created. What policy or law can be passed, also exists within the limitations of the system. Want to avoid a particular evolutionary path? Positive evil, ignore the actors of that ideology. 
Regards,
Varun

“You will perceive that each new phase of evolution achieves the utmost complexity that its factors permit, and then settles down to a rhythmic repetition of the sequence it has reached.”  This reminds me of several major types of modern technology, which have reached what can only be called peak evolution.  For instance, nuclear power technology is merely a glorified steam engine.  Computer technology, at least in my opinion, hasn’t done anything new since astronauts landed on the moon, it has just been more of the same thing, but with faster and smaller components.  
“You can see that there are times when the Lower Astral would receive a stimulus and times when the Upper Spiritual would like- wise, although this is not so strong as the corresponding Cosmic plane is not so near. This is one of the things that check evolution and often set up trouble in a system.”  No wonder becoming a truly great musician takes FOREVER, because it feels as if the spiritual plane is born a master and three bazillion years must be spent drumming this into the hands, mouth, or whatever else is being used to make sound on the physical plane.

On the Solar Angel/Manasaputra, one source is Blavatsky. I understand this entity to be distinguished from the Solar Logos who is glossed as the more evolved “Kumara” in the esoteric tradition I favor. The Solar Angel has the permanence and stability of the Platonic archetype. We sometimes think of the Solar Angel as the Watcher, “the medium of expression for the Monad or pure spirit, just as is the personality for the Ego on the lower level.” Would this complement or contradict the Cosmic Doctrine?

Ah! I was just going to ask about ever-increasing complexity, but your response to David (above) makes it a little clearer for me. At the end of last month’s chapter it sounded like everything was going to keep complexifying forever, building on the static forms of the previous phases of evolution. I take it we just haven’t got to the devolutionary phase yet. Am I right, or did I miss something?
On another note, today in my meditation I found myself wondering about the Circles, which so far haven’t seemed to get as much attention as the Rays. As I played with the image I realized that if you hold the Ring-Chaos stationary in your mind’s eye and track the path of a Great Organism as it circles around the Central Stillness AND rises and falls with the Ring-Cosmos’ revolutions within the Ring-Chaos, you get a very pretty spherical spiral shape, sort of like the streaking on a marble.
So the Rays, the Circles, and the Prime Atoms all have spirals incorporated into their structures. So cool!

Dewey, I’m by no means sure that deities are actually immortal. It’s an interesting fact of religious history that a deity’s ability to perform miracles doesn’t keep well; you get the really big miracles early on in a religion’s history, and then things taper off into the sort of autumnal condition in which (for example) Christianity is today, when G.K. Chesterton can be proposed for canonization because some couples who were having difficulty conceiving prayed to him and a child followed not too long thereafter — a very, very minor miracle indeed. So it’s possible that religions die because deities die, or in some other way age out. 
Varun, a fine meditation. Thank you. 
Kimberly, excellent! Yes, exactly. 
Y. Chireau, it certainly seems complementary to me — no surprises there, as Fortune got much of her initial training via the Theosophical Society. 
David, good question. Our text doesn’t say, and the other presentations of the same general cosmology I know of have very little to say about what happens on the other six Cosmic Planes. 
Jeffrey, thank you, but my one experience publishing an article with The Pomegranate was dismal enough that I don’t plan on submitting anything to that journal ever again. 
Dylan, bingo. We’ve talked already about the great days and nights of the Cosmos, the periods of creation and destruction on the one hand and of settling into stasis on the other, but there’s a lot more to be covered as we proceed.

For whatever it may be worth in this context, all the Deities of the Old Norse lore and legends are mortal; they will all die, or be killed, someday, to be replaced by new Deities not yet existing, and thus still unnamed and unknown.  Since this was the first mythology I was ever exposed to as a child (as a part of my Danish heritage), in later life I always had a certain amount of trouble taking other religions and philosophies seriously once they started talking about immortal souls and immortal Deities, or even omnipotent and omnibenevolent Deities.  I’m still inclined to think that the whole Divine lot of Them have finite lifespans, however lengthy they may be.

The limits that make so many possibilities.

Does the “as above, so below” recapitulation of structure mean the same principles that apply to atoms apply to us as well? The tension between moving faster and more freely without influences/attachments and evolving or travelling further by accretion certainly seems relevant on an interpersonal level, especially at the moment. 
@JMG: “That said, why Saturn and Venus should be more symbols of the whole than any other planetary energy makes a good theme for meditation.”
When I was meditating recently, albeit on Paths of Wisdom rather than CosDoc, it occurred to me that Venus/Aphrodite really expresses the balance or reconciliation between unity and differentiation: love is a unifying force, but it’s a force that needs a subject and object (which can be “the divine” or “humanity” or “creation”), and thus one that needs form and the separation it provides. Likewise beauty, as per the discussion on art in the last couple posts, and to bring Ishtar into it, even war in a lot of ways. 
I don’t know if that puts it in a unique or rare position among the planetary influences (I could certainly see Chronos-time being a similar kind of force, for Saturn–it separates us all in some ways, both from each other and from who we were, but we’re all united by moving through it in the same direction and at the same rate–as well as the more birth-and-death aspects of Binah) or if that’s just my own biases regarding that particular planet/divinity. 🙂

John—
Re other Beings, great and small, and the Other, more generally 
The contemplation of the Cosmos as being alive and swarming with things which are alive was made dramatically manifest to me just a moment ago as I lifted the cover of one of my fermentation crocks in preparation for making a nice soup.  Although I was fully expecting it, the thick, vibrantly-colored mat of living stuff floating on top directly confronted the underlying (Faustian, mechanistic) notions of our current societal narrative.  I laughed at myself as I scooped it all out, observing the various layers of reaction within me.  One thing I have gained from this community as a whole (and the Cos Doc discussions in particular) is an entirely new perspective on the Other and for living things: actual, concrete living things, as opposed to this abstraction called Life.
I don’t know if sub-planar effects were at work or not, but it was a fascinating experience!

JMG – Again I’d like to thank you for your commentary on the Cosmic Doctrine. I’ve been trying to read it, and “understand” it, but I confess that I don’t. However the other night I woke up at around 2am and for a moment I understood what was meant by “These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are designed to train the mind, not to inform it.” It was a weird moment of clarity for me, and when I tried to understand what I felt clearly in that moment in my “normal” way of understanding, the understanding seemed to vanish. I don’t know if that makes sense to you or anyone else, but it’s a strange feeling I have been having about various things for the last year.
Anyway, something inside me suddenly has this knowing that there’s something out there unknowable. It’s a really weird strange and scary feeling, while also being somewhat comforting. Like the feeling of simultaneously being scared of death, but not scared. Also like the feeling that I am going crazy, yet suddenly my life has completely turned around and is going perfectly.
Other than all that, I don’t really understand a word of this book. I read it and it’s just stuff going in. I’m envious of those of you who seem to understand, and thankful for your analysis.

JMG,
It may be that the gods have finite lifespans, or that human societies outgrow them and move on, but I don’t think that explains the worldwide descent of women in society and the diminishing role of goddesses while the gods were not diminished. Perhaps they were later as well, but I think that was a difference in time and therefore not related.

JMG: regarding your comments on the lifespan of deities. I take it that the efficacy of a deity as a focus for magical techniques doesn’t depend on whether that being is still “alive” in the sense you described to Dewey? After all, there are still mages making effective use of deities and god-names even farther from the peak of their reported miracle-working than the Christian god.

I have been contemplating this response since last month’s chapter post, so I apologize if this seems like a step back. While I did indeed do a mental double take when Fortune mentioned the 10-sided atom (Great Organism) settling into the Seventh Plane, the more I have re-read the pertinent chapters, 5 through 7, and thought about it, I don’t see a contradiction at all.
There seem to be settled atoms, those that flow around in the plane corresponding to their “weight,” and traveling atoms, those that have “formed alliances among themselves and become composite.” These atoms move along the Rays as their weight makes them susceptible to the centrifugal force of the Rings, Rays, and Planes. As they move out, they continue to gather more “weight” and become more complex. As I see it, it is when they become 10-sided that they encounter the Ring-Pass-Not and start the journey back to the Central Sun (or Stillness). A quote from the end of Chapter 5, “It is only when the extremely elaborate atoms of the Seventh Circle form alliances that they start back up the spiral to the Central Sun.” At that point there is nowhere else to go but back because they are stopped by the Ring-Pass-Not. All of these atoms starting back up the spiral would have to be 10-sided figures because the three through nine sided figures all have a place on a particular Plane and will remain there until they gather more complexity. And perhaps some of them are forever stationary and remain in the plane according to their structure. After all, there are some who will board a boat for an uncertain voyage to a new world, and some who will instead stay behind to tend the fields.
The atoms with a nine sided core structure can only become more elaborate and be pulled out of their Plane by becoming a 10-sided figure. And it seems to me that even the smallest atom, the three-sided, as it moves outward on the planes gathering matter from each plane, becoming more complex, more weighty, would eventually become a 10-sided Great Organism once it has spent some time and gathered matter in the Seventh Plane.
In my interpretation, all the Great Organisms are ten sided, no matter what their base structure is, which could be anything from a three- to nine-sided formation. And they settle into the Plane of their structure of origin after journeying through the Cosmos, returning to the Central Stillness, resting, and then being pulled out to the Plane of origin.
I have the image of a fountain shaped in tiers like a traditional wedding cake, the contents overflowing into the next tier down, getting heavier and more complex, flowing back to the origin once there is nowhere else to go.
I hope I’m not being too much of a Fundamentalist here, but I do think there is a certain logic (not to mention poetry) to the movements and the gatherings, the accretions and the sorting out of the atoms and the Great Organisms.
Thanks!

As far as I can tell, you haven’t touched on the idea found on page 47 of the revised edition – that the evolution of the Cosmos continues until the Great Organisms burst past the Ring-Pass-Not and out into the Unmanifest, there to start new Cosmoi.
I like the idea (probably because of my Faustian upbringing), and I like the very close of the chapter, in which Fortune proposes that an adept, in tune with the evolution of the Cosmos, eventually becomes a system, a true microcosm, himself.
But questions do rise up. Is Fortune talking about the original Cosmos bursting apart, or the many smaller Cosmoi generated by the Great Organisms? It seems like if a ‘bursting apart’ is an event at the lower levels of manifestation, it would be possible at the highest level.
Also, could this be a definition of the Great Work of the magician, to turn oneself into a new Cosmos?

“So it’s possible that religions die because deities die, or in some other way age out.”
So also suggests the great prophet Terry Pratchett.  😉  I’m not ready to give up on Bastet just yet, though.

Additional thought: while the spiritual/occult connection between Venus and war may have dwindled, we do see echoes of it in culture a fair amount. “All’s fair in love and war,” Pat Benetar songs, and so forth. So Ishtar hasn’t vanished completely. 🙂
I also do think the notion of connecting war/conflict with a female deity, particularly at a phase in human history when notions of “civilized” fighting really hadn’t taken over, is apt. I’ve discussed with our host and Robert Mathiesen the fact that, at least among my social circle, the men are likely to forgive and be nice and give people the benefit of the doubt, whereas I and most of my female friends are on the crush-your-enemies*, wailing-and-gnashing-of-teeth end of things. (Robert once said that the goal of a fight between men was for both to be able to walk away with their pride intact. My response was a wide-eyed “Why would you want to do *that*?”–okay, tactical reasons, but if it’s possible to leave an enemy alive enough to know you’ve beaten them and yet powerless to *do* anything about it, that’s the ideal for me and most women I’ve hung around with.)
My own suspicion is that this is a function of women’s historical place in society, and that, in general, honor and forgiveness and so forth are ideals that people in power can afford, and the rest of us not so much. (The Marquess of Queensbury was…well, a Marquess. And Jesus was the son of a deity, which probably helps considerably on the letting-things-slide front.) But for whatever reason, I think Kipling’s poem is largely right about the female of the species–and interestingly, a whole lot of pre-Christian mythology echoed that. Athena as relatively-non-vengeful**-goddess-of-war was kind of the exception among Ishtar and the Morrigan and, indeed, even some of her fellow Hellenic deities, like Nemesis and the Erinyes.  
* Given this, I might theorize that the women in the saying aren’t so much lamenting as vowing revenge.
** By which I mean “no more vengeful than most of her pantheon, and considerably less than some”.

Is God male or female?

It’s late in the comments cycle, and comments are dramatically less than on other topics.  I continue to read and reread the assigned chapters, and follow the comments with interest.  For many years, my “esoteric” reading was focused on various “fourth way” authors.  What DF has written seems to me pretty consistent with the writings of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, R. Collin, and so forth.  The word “esoteric” had great allure back in the day: it signified a sort of spiritual elitism, and naturally we tended to think of ourselves as special.  Now I regard the word “esoteric” with a corresponding suspicion.  Carry on, please, with the CosDoc project.

To piggyback on Cliff’s question: assuming the great organisms do ultimately burst out of the original cosmos (as I think the text seems to imply), this would suggest that the newly formed cosmoi are no longer subject to the influences of the rhythms of the primal cosmos that spawned them. Thus they have achieved the feat of levitation Fortune spoke of earlier, having freed themselves from influences and therefore from gravity. 
Of course, presumably by then they have integrated the patterns of their “parent” cosmos so thoroughly into their own structure that they repeat those rhythms internally without needing to be prompted from without. You could look at that as one wat to describe the difference between childhood and adulthood! It also reminds me of the defining characteristic of existence in Gwynfedd – that one’s body now lies within its soul rather thsn surrounding and gestating it.
On another note, I was struck recently by the way that the CosDoc sheds new light on a key phrase from the OTO’s Thelemic ritual liturgy: “O circle of stars, whereof our Father is but the younger brother”. If we assume the Father is the Solar Logos, the circle of stars would presumably be the larger cosmos frim which the former emerged (represented in the Thelemic system by Nuit, the goddess of primordial darkness whose womb spawns the points of light that become individual conscious entities).

I’ve been thinking about the metaphor of a solar system and how it relates to life for the past few days.  One idea that keeps nagging at me is how the planets are born into a path, following that path with only subtle changes.  It certainly lends support to the idea that our lives have a pre-determined destiny from the outset.  Considering the fact that we are born to parents whom we don’t choose in a society we don’t choose at a time we don’t choose, all of which impact our lives and development, it does seem we are rather fated to become a certain individual.  
 As I was tossing these ideas around, I realized also how we are a reflection of the cosmos.  The order and stability present there can be present within us.  And when we make the movement to become more orderly (disciplined) with our life, the inner world can reflect back out to the outer.  This made me realize the importance of meditation, and stillness.  It was only because I took 5 minutes to go out and look at the grass.. err, patches of grass and snow, that this reflection was realized.  And it makes a great deal of sense, especially when someone such as Gandhi said one of the simplest truths, that we should be the change we want to see.
So those realizations, that despite my not being a planet, or moon, or sun, or something bigger yet realizing how those things and all things are reflected within me and how I reflect back out to them, it didn’t leave me feeling worthless and in despair but instead left me feeling a sense of importance and how I could make an impact, even as subtle as it may be.

Hi John Michael,
“If you take spirituality seriously, it seems to me, it doesn’t really work to make changes in the status of the gods depend on human economic and political shifts…
I read an account that the Aboriginals believe that the old ones are still around, as would be expected. The inference was that the old ones were also impervious to man made problems in the biosphere, and in fact I’d have to suggest that they’d probably seen it all before, and may probably do so again.
Cheers
Chris

Ahhh, the first seven chapters of the Cosmic Doctrine, a journey in discovery of the grand forces that make up the universe and all we know. Words that paint pictures, descriptions that provide thoughtful readers with visions of the enormous currents and forces that compose our world. Beginning with the largest of the large, so large we can barely comprehend the moving flow, in turn causing a birth of counter movements, settling into stability but never static, there is always more movement. The Rings, Rays, and Circles, and resulting vortices, smaller eddies, all produced from movements and counter movements, reactions. The Atoms, small yet gathering energy, accumulating weight, move and travel, find their place, as they make their way around the Cosmos, experiencing all possible influences. Leading finally to the birth of a Solar System organized around a Great Organism, a Sun, huge beyond comprehension, powerful beyond reason, giver of life as we know it.
Dion Fortune gives us seven chapters of logos, reasoned words on a page, carefully building the concepts, the vision, reiterating and explaining in greater detail with each chapter, recapitulating and adding a little more with each telling. And suddenly logos becomes pathos, an awakening of emotional connection, as the vision of the Cosmos comes alive, and we realize that as above, so below. The vast has echoes in the infinitesimal, in our very essence. The heart opens to the poetry, magic, and wonder of the universe as the visions depicted take shape in the mind’s eye.
And then, WHAM! We learn that sentience is not exclusively the property of a nervous system. And pathos suddenly evolves into Eros / Agape as we are informed that this vast dance of space, this formation of forces, this Cosmos of Rings is sentient, aware, has basic individuality, like us. We must therefore by necessity have affinities with these vast Cosmic beings and with all existences in the universe. The world around us is sentient; we are not alone, ever. And the heart breaks open completely and dissolves into the vision, the Sun, the Moon, the vast expanse of stars on a clear night, the movement, life, becoming one with the ALL.

Dewey,
Something interesting I’ve been noticing around our town lately is an increase – no, it’s more an infiltration – of women engaging in “man’s work.” There is a young female mechanic working at one of the tire shops, possibly straight out of high school. I ran into a woman who was obviously a self-employed contractor at Lowe’s yesterday, in grubby clothes, buying a load of materials. No male accomplice to be found. 
Bastet is undoubtedly polishing up her decolletage as we speak.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Evolution of a Great Entity 
February 13, 2019John Michael Greer59 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 8, “The Evolution of a Great Entity,” pp. 39-43.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 7, “The Evolution of a Great Entity,” pp. 55-57, and the first half of the following chapter, to the bottom of p. 60.
Commentary:
With this chapter the text shifts in an important way. Up to now, The Cosmic Doctrine has made use of physics as a basis for its “nearest approximate metaphors.” The images that we’ve been presented all have to do with space and movement.  Within that framework, a kind of visionary astronomy has been unfolded, setting out the principles of occult philosophy as though we’re talking about the formation of suns and planets.
There are good reasons for that approach. For most people in the industrial world, the narratives of modern science provide the raw material for our thinking, in exactly the same way that the mythic narratives of ancient Greece, let’s say, provided the raw material for Classical thought. Many Americans who grew up when I did will recall the glorious Chesley Bonestell paintings of the newborn Earth commissioned by Life Magazine and published in a very widely read coffee-table book, The World We Live In; equivalent images were commonplace in Fortune’s time and today as well. These are our creation myths, and it was a wise choice on Fortune’s part to use them to provide a half-conscious mental background for her teaching.
The challenge that has to be faced by any set of metaphors that relies on physics, though, is the barrier that materialist science has tried to raise between matter and mind. That’s the barrier Fortune needs to get past in order to make her account of the cosmos relevant to magic—the art and science, remember, of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will. She does the job with considerable aplomb by the straightforward tactic of driving right through the middle of the barrier, sending fragments flying in all directions.
Let’s see how this works. She starts by asking us to imagine the consciousness of a Great Entity, one of the traveling atoms of the Cosmos that has passed through the whole process of Cosmic evolution and settled down on one of the seven planes of being to create a solar system of its own. At first, the consciousness of that Great Entity would simply be a dim sense of whirling, reflecting the movement of the Ring-Cosmos. That becomes established, and fades from awareness in the same way that any repeated stimulus does. (Pay attention to your tongue. Before I mentioned it, were you aware of the sensations it was receiving?)  Then the secondary movement of the Ring-Chaos follows, entering consciousness and then fading out as the Great Entity becomes habituated to it. From there, step by step, every other phase in the evolution of the Cosmos is reflected in the consciousness of the Great Entity.
Why? Because the consciousness of the Great Entity is nothing other than these patterns of habituated movement. Fortune points out: “(T)here is an unbroken line of development from movement to thought. Tangential movement is a simple form of reaction. Thought is an infinitely complex form of reaction. It is a question of difference of degree, not of difference of kind” (p. 40 revised edition, p. 56 Millennial edition).  Think of your consciousness as an extremely complex set of movements that have worked out all their interactions and whirl smoothly and silently on, until disrupted by some new influence.
It’s common for people to treat this sort of understanding as though it’s a dismissal of the very idea of consciousness—as though it’s saying “consciousness is nothing more than very complex movement.” It would be just as accurate to say that movement is nothing less than very simple consciousness, and that physics studies those forms of consciousness that are simple enough that their results can be predicted by mathematical formulae.  To say that movement and consciousness are the same thing doesn’t mean that consciousness doesn’t exist—it means that everything is conscious to one degree or another.
The point to take from this discussion is that Fortune’s account doesn’t set out two separate realms of mind and matter (philosophers call this dualism); nor does it see mind as an effect or product or illusion created by matter (in philosophers’ jargon, materialism); nor does it see matter an effect or product or illusion created by mind (to philosophers, this is idealism). Rather, to Fortune, mind and matter are the same thing experienced in slightly different ways—or, in modern industrial society, chopped in half to make the universe fit an ideology with a covert agenda. (This makes Fortune’s account, in philosophers’ language, a variety of monism—though, as we’ll see, Fortune shows that philosophical monism and religious theism are perfectly compatible if you approach them both in the right way.)
We’ll get to these latter points as we proceed. For now, let’s turn back to the text and watch the slow dawning of complex consciousness in the mind of a Great Entity. As it finishes the process of Cosmic evolution and settles down into a stable orbit on one of the planes of being, and the other atoms that accompanied it out to that plane settle into their own stable orbit, the Great Entity repeats the motions that it absorbed from the Cosmos, and imparts those same motions to the swarm of atoms that surround it. The swarm proceeds to sort itself out into the miniature Cosmos we call a solar system and Fortune, like the astronomers of her childhood, called a Universe. (The term “universe” didn’t get its modern meaning until the discovery of other galaxies in the mid-20th century; the term literally means “that which rotates together,” and was already being used in the Middle Ages for the Earth-centered cosmos imagined in those days.)
Fortune talks about this same process in two ways, once in terms of motion, once in terms of consciousness; these are the same thing, but our habits of thought make it difficult to grasp that, thus the repetition. The Great Entity repeats the motions of the Cosmos, and thus—this is simply another way of saying the same thing—formulates the concept of those motions. The repetition of a motion, after all, is the simplest form of reflection on that motion. So we can begin to see the Great Entity meditating on the conditions of its being, the vast movements of the Cosmos it absorbed during its long pilgrimage through time. As they respond to these motions, the atoms surrounding the Great Entity recapitulate that pilgrimage in a reflected form. They absorb the fruits of its experience; we might even say that they receive an initiation from the Great Entity, and are introduced to the modes of consciousness of the Great Entity. Certain aspects of religion can be understood in this way; others—well, we’ll get to that further on.
The solar system doesn’t simply settle down into habituated motion and unconsciousness, though, because it isn’t isolated. Three main sets of influences from the Cosmos, as noted in previous commentaries, affect the solar system as it sweeps around the Central Sun on its orbit. First of all, the great phases of the Rings continue to affect it. When the Ring-Cosmos is moving toward the Ring-Chaos, all the solar systems within the Cosmos are stirred into new activity and the generation of novelty; when the Ring-Cosmos moves away from the Ring-Chaos, all the solar systems settle down to the elaboration and synthesis of the new influences absorbed in the previous phase.
Second, the Great Entity and its solar system pass through the twelve Rays one after another. These rays are far from interchangeable; each one has its own distinctive influences, which are reflected within the solar system in the form of the twelve Zodiacal influences. Think of the way that the Earth passes through each of the twelve forces of the Zodiac as it circles the Sun; the same thing happens, on a vastly greater time scale, as the Great Entity in the Sun follows its own orbit around the Central Stillness. This is the Cosmic factor behind the astrological ages marked by the precession of the equinoxes: the change from one age to another happens when our solar system, in its orbit around the Central Stillness, passes from one Ray to another.
Third, other solar systems are sweeping around the Central Sun on their own orbits, and those on each plane move at a different rate of speed—the closer to the Central Sun, the faster the rate of movement. Here in the seventh Cosmic plane, we’re subject to the influences of solar systems on every other plane of being. Those influences have two parts, one of which we’ve discussed already and one of which we haven’t.
The one we’ve discussed is the (metaphorical, remember) gravitational attraction exerted by systems of each plane on the atoms that share the same geometric keynote of that plane. A Great Entity on the seventh Cosmic plane has matter of every other plane in its solar system, and so when a Great Entity on the sixth Cosmic plane goes past, all atoms that have a hexagonal keynote are influenced by it; when a Great Entity on the fifth Cosmic Plane goes past, it’s the turn of atoms with a pentagonal structure to be affected, and so on. Only the atoms of dense matter are unaffected by these influences.
The form of influence we haven’t discussed so far is what happens when a solar system of a higher plane passes (metaphorically) between our solar system and the Central Stillness. That weakens the gravitational influence of the Central Stillness, so that every atom of the higher plane tends to move inward toward the solar system moving past, but every atom of every other plane tends to drift further out toward the Ring-Pass-Not, the boundary of the Cosmos.  Our solar system doesn’t fly apart when this happens, because it has its own gravitational attraction, and a complex network of stresses in equilibrium holding it together. Those keep it on one piece, but the pressure of the contending forces puts strains on the structure of the solar system and sets up various unbalanced patterns of movement.
These, in turn, are the origin of positive evil. We’ve talked already about negative evil and positive evil—the basic inertia and resistance that provides a thrust-block for creative action, on the one hand, and the actions of individual beings that follow the momentum of the Ring-Chaos rather than that of the Ring-Cosmos, on the other.  Negative evil is necessary for anything to come into existence—if there were no inertia, no thrust-block against which the forces of the Ring-Cosmos can push, there would be no Cosmos at all.  Positive evil, by contrast, isn’t built into the structure of existence; it’s accidental, though in a sufficiently complex Cosmos the accidents that bring it into being are inevitable.
Fortune gives us two new labels for negative evil and positive evil; she calls the former Cosmic evil, and the second universal evil. (A universe, again, is what early 20th century astronomers called what we call a solar system.)  Negative or Cosmic evil is always present in every solar system, forming the background inertia against which the solar system’s evolution unfolds.
Positive or universal evil, by contrast, comes and goes; it appears when a set of discordant stresses moves through a system, and disappears as the discords are gradually brought back into balance. Positive evil thus takes the most extreme forms in the early phases of any evolutionary process, when the patterns of force that will eventually bring the whole system into balance haven’t yet become habituated. Over time, the balance becomes harder to disrupt, until finally the entire system has settled into perfect balance—and then, of course, a new Cosmic phase begins and the process starts over again.
Positive evil takes two forms, which Fortune calls by indicative names. Perverted force she calls sin; perverted form she call disease. (Remember that the word “perverted” means simply “diverted from its normal course”—the common sexual meaning of the term is secondary to that basic meaning, and isn’t what Fortune is talking about here.)  While the term “sin” is unpopular these days, it does a better job of communicating the particular kind of imbalance Fortune is discussing here than any of its partial synonyms. Sin and disease, unbalanced force and unbalanced form, are the tangles that work their way into a solar system and have to be pulled out straight again in the course of evolution.
There’s a subtle point here that we’ll be exploring in more detail later on. In one sense, as we’ve just seen, positive evil is the product of forces from outside the solar system setting discordant patterns at work within it. In another sense, as discussed earlier on, positive evil is the product of unforced choices on the part of individual beings. That seems like a contradiction, doesn’t it? As we’ll see, though, that apparent contradiction resolves itself as we begin to come to grips with the process Fortune calls epigenesis and less careful philosophies call free will.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on March 13. Until then, have at it!

Thanks for helping us through this dense book! 
One question, more about the creation of the book. How are we to take the method that the book was written? Did it actually happen the way it is described in the introduction or is there some literary liberties there?







 David, by the lake says:

John–
Obviously there will be considerably more thought put into this month’s chapter, but one thing that leaped out at me in this first reading.
In your discussion of positive evil, you pointed out Fortune’s notions of perverted force and perverted form.  Given the parallels with the triads of the druidic elements and the columns of the Tree of Life, what of the middle pillar/third element of consciousness/nwyfre?  That is, is there “perverted consciousness” as well?  If so, how would it relate to the other two?  If not, why not?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								February 13, 2019 at 2:56 pm							




Matt, that’s an interesting question with no really definite answer. Fortune lived and wrote at a time when some claim of superhuman inspiration was standard in works of occult philosophy; Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrine and Heindel’s Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, the two most widely read books of the type in her time, both present their authors as humble scribes taking down teachings from inner-plane masters, as of course do such equivalent works as Yeats’ A Vision and Crowley’s The Book of the Law. To what extent that was a literary device, to what extent it was a description of the actual process of writing, and to what extent it was something in between, perhaps rationalized into the latter in retrospect, is really hard to judge. 
If I may offer a personal example, the first volume of The Weird of Hali basically wrote itself over an eight-week period — I’ve never had anything of that scale come into being so quickly, requiring so little conscious effort on my part. If it had been a work of occult philosophy, and if I’d been alive in Fortune’s time, I might well have decided that it was communicated by some superhuman entity. 
David, excellent! Keep that in mind as we proceed; Fortune has some very specific things to say about that.

Greetings John, what would you say is the “ideology with a covert agenda” in modern industrial society that chops in reality in half to make the universe fit? What is the ultimate goal of such an agenda, and who’s agenda is it?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								February 13, 2019 at 5:16 pm							




Ethan, why, we’ll be discussing that in several upcoming posts. For the time being, perhaps you’d like to take that as a theme for meditation!

JMG, 
the first thing that comes to my mind when I think it over is this: rituals use gestures and movements, because it is in reality the most basic form of consciousness. In other words, its not the insight that drive the change, but change in patters of movement that generate higher-order insights and experiences? So even when not fully understanding or engaging without great zeal, if practices enough times, the well-designed ritual will have cascading effect on the magician?

My mind goes to the story of Adam and Eve, who inhabit their own mini-Universe until the snake comes and introduces positive evil in two forms of original sin and pain (in childbirth and having to work for food) for daring to expand outside their bubble.  If we look at the Bible story, there does seem to be a certain tragic inevitability to that particular origin story.  So it’s probably fruitful to look at other creation myths too, right?







 Onething says: 



								February 13, 2019 at 7:49 pm							




“…the consciousness of the Great Entity is nothing other than these patterns of habituated movement.”
It seems to me that consciousness is the context within which awareness of movement and the slow complexification into thought can happen. A potential conscious entity must have some content for its conscious awareness, and that would be the movement. A consciousness must have something to be conscious OF, and thus it might seem that this newborn atom-entity develops consciousness over time. But the substrate that makes that growth in consciousness possible has to be there, a basic awareness.

Dion says at the beginning of Chapter 7 that basically now we’re going to take a look at things from within, or from a subjective point of view.  Thinking about that in terms of the Tree of Life, the Sephiroth are objective (or relating to the Macrocosm), while the Paths between them are subjective, in that they relate to an individual’s consciousness.  The act of Pathworking is to comprehend and incorporate or internalize the various states of consciousness symbolized in the Tree of Life.  Like following an instruction manual to re-calibrate or reprogram our consciousness in the image of the divine consciousness.
From the text: “This central nucleus will have implicit in it, the modes of reaction to which it became habituated during its experience of the phases of Cosmic evolution.”
Similarly:  “Having had the Cosmic factors implanted in its nature by the experiences, it proceeds to bring them into function independently of the Cosmic impulse of its own momentum…”
This could refer to how on the evolutionary journey back up the Tree of Life along the paths, every path imparts a glimpse at a different type of consciousness which is eventually retained by the initiate – he or she begins to think and act in accordance with the framework of the universal consciousness implicit in the Tree.  These changes of consciousness gradually become internalized.
I’m probably reading too much into this part of the book, as I’m not sure if she is really referring to humanity at this stage in the game. The Great Entities might be beings on order more of say, a Sun God, but because of the microcosm/macrocosm (As above, so below), the concepts she’s discussing here might equally apply to us.
What stands out for me here is the fractal nature of the universe – how it repeats its basic framework at different scales.  As in the evolution of the Great Entities – they learn or are initiated by the framework or basic characteristics of the Cosmos which have been laid down before them.
And one more thought from this bit of text: “This nuclear atom continues to make its accustomed reactions owing to the momentum of its particles.  These actions upon its part induce the corresponding reactions of the loose aggregations of matter from each Cosmic plane that are gathered about it.” 
This made me think about how an individual can affect the consciousness of those around them by drawing them into sympathy with his or her thoughts or moods.  This can be done either intentionally or unintentionally.  An example of this would be the way that someone in a good mood can lift up the consciousness of those around them, or how a grumpy, angry person can make the people around them also grumpy and angry.

Well, *now* I’m aware of my tongue. Thanks. 😛
Seriously, though, I find the whole relationship between motion and consciousness fascinating. On a human level, it reminds me of phenomena like how smiling makes people happier even if they’re not doing it out of happiness, and other “fake it ’till you make it” principles. For a less literal sense of “motion,” there’s also the tendency of spies or actors to find their roles influencing them. (Happens in LARPs too: the concept of “bleed” has people who care more about committed relationships than I do freaking out about in-character romance on a semi-regular basis.)







 John Michael Greer says: 



								February 13, 2019 at 11:36 pm							




Changeling, excellent! Yes, in fact, one of the reasons that effective magic always has a kinesthetic element is that body movement is as primal an experience as you can have. 
Kimberly, it is indeed. 
Onething, Fortune is talking about the origins of that substrate, not about the origins of its content. 
Stefania, while we’re not talking about human beings yet — our species doesn’t show up for some chapters to come — your point stands; As above, so below; what works for the Solar Logos works also, on our smaller scale, for each of us. 
Isabel, just one of the services I offer! . Yes, exactly — every emotion starts out as a motion, and only later is internalized as an inner perception.







 Onething says: 



								February 14, 2019 at 2:35 am							




“Onething, Fortune is talking about the origins of that substrate, not about the origins of its content. ”
I dunno…I have a couple of problems with this. I guess the main one is it means that matter is primary rather than consciousness. Whatever the void before the ring cosmos and ring pass not consists of – something gets into motion, but what was it before that? What set it in motion? 
So it seems that you are saying that consciousnessless movement leads to consciousness.

JMG et al
I found David (DbtL) reference to nwyfre the Druidical third element instantly helpful, even if I know not why, yet. It sent me to look up nwyfre  and again this led helpfully to your own writing for AODA http://aoda.org/publications/articles-on-druidry/threedruidelements/   .
I have been contemplating the formation of the Logos for a while and have begun to find DF’s ‘physics’ metaphor of a ‘Solar Universe’ leading somewhere.  I am still pondering, if very vaguely, that ‘knowledge’ is related to ‘movement’ and ‘transfer’, even when it is apparently ‘frozen’ in ‘architecture’ and ‘form’, and perhaps likewise in ‘memory’.
On a practical level this from your AODA piece is apposite to my recently coining a term for my own use Failure of the Scientific Mind. This was to deliberately sound  a bit over-the-top rhetorically (smile), but for sure the following quote is relevant to the world I live in:  “Time and again, well-intentioned experts using the best tools science has to offer have tried to tackle problems outside the laboratory and failed abjectly. Rational architecture and urban planning, scientific agriculture and forestry, and innovative schemes for education and social reform often cause many more problems than they solve, and fail to yield the results predicted by theory.”

Changeling, long ago I came across a book by Serge Kahili King which taught Hawaiian Shamanism which forms the sole way I see the World.
One of its principles is that memory is stored in your physical body, specifically the muscles tense at the time of your learning the lesson. That repetitive movement re-enforces that knowledge. Pairing a specific action you want to have happen with a unique body motion, allows your to re-enforce that desired action every time you repeat the motion.
The Body Knows on a fundamental level and it can change Reality.
The US Army did a study that I’m aware of. See they are very interested in teach people to shoot well. But that usually requires them to shoot a lot of bullets. The Army wanted a way to cut some of that cost, so they had some people just practice aiming an unloaded 45 caliber pistol and dry firing it.
Draw, Aim and Shoot.
They found that the actual experience of firing a real bullet wasn’t the important thing, it was building up the muscle memory of the action. You could teach good shooting without wasting a lot of bullets.
I suspect that occult ritual does the same thing. When you try and affect change on the World, and do it with the same gestures each time, it re-enforces your intent. That you can mentally re-enforce your actions by just taking a moment and re-acting the movements associated with the ritual.
Never underestimate the power our physical self has to affect change in the higher plane.

Thank you, JMG, for this guided tour of the CosDoc. Even though this is the first time I am commenting, I have been following along since the beginning . This past month’s break was especially productive as I was able to restart the book from the beginning as well as catch up on some missed commentary.
I have found that Fortune’s metaphorical framework of the Cosmos to be quite beautiful and compelling. We’ve watched the birth of a primal atom from the vortex of the tangential forces caused by the secondary movement of the rays. We’ve seen this primal atom attract and bond with other primal atoms to create composite atoms and then seen this composite atom follow the path of the flowing Ray to grow and move through the cosmic planes. Then the atom, when it reaches the maximum complexity of that sector, bounces and spirals off the Ring-Pass-Not at an angle that will ensure the composite atom will travel all 12 Rays. Movement begets movement. Upon completion, we see this traveling atom rest in the Central Stillness, basking in all its glory, until the Ring Cosmos passes into its negative phase and sends forth our experienced atom through the Cosmic Planes once again, this time as a Great Organism, with great gravity, collecting static atoms it encounters throughout the Planes, until it finds its natural resting place according to its original composition and collected mass. Now, our Great Organism can settle down to its own orbit and establish its own cosmos. Internal movement  becomes habituated and must be maintained. These movements become implicit to the inner elaboration of the Great Organism. All the cosmic factors of its cosmic evolution are combined and recombined in an infinite diversity of a manifested universe. This momentum of movement, independent of the forces that created it, is our evidence of the Cosmic Will, the creation of the Great Entity. Thoughts are infinitely complex movements. Each thought an unique collection of movement and experience. This Great Entity puts in motion the memory of its experiences and uses the dynamism of Good and the thrust-block of Evil to create its own cosmos. It knows Good and Evil and is therefore a God.
Just as the Great Entity creates its own universe, so do we create our own universe, the central point to our Cosmos. As above, so below. We too, are all gods, or at least potential gods as we learn the characteristics of Good and Evil.

Chageling’s comment and your response made me think of the role of muscle memory and practice, practice, practice has on any type of creative endeavor.  If you are going to make something, you have to go through the motions to do so.  The more you make those motions the finer your creation becomes, but “perfection” isn’t the name of the game, mastery is.  There are always variables that create distinctions in any piece no matter how practiced you are.  Motion, consciousness; motion, creation; motion, experience.  Heady stuff.

In Virgil’s time, this creation myth was top-notch science (translation by Greenough, 1895):
“…for he sang
how through the mighty void the seeds were driven
of earth, air, ocean, and of liquid fire,
how all that is from these beginnings grew,
and the young world itself took solid shape,
then ‘gan its crust to harden, and in the deep
shut Nereus off, and mould the forms of things
little by little; and how the earth amazed
beheld the new sun shining, and the showers
fall, as the clouds soared higher, what time the woods
‘gan first to rise, and living things to roam
scattered among the hills that knew them not.”
It sounds much better in Latin:
“Namque canebat, uti magnum per inane coacta
semina terrarumque animaeque marisque fuissent,
et liquidi simul ignis; ut his exordia primis
omnia et ipse tener mundi concreverit orbis;
tum durare solum et discludere Nerea ponto
coeperit, et rerum paulatim sumere formas;
iamque novum terrae stupeant lucescere solem,
altius atque cadant submotis nubibus imbres;
incipiant silvae cum primum surgere, cumque
rara per ignaros errent animalia montis.”
I can hear the rain falling in “altius atque cadant”!
The whole poem is marvellous, my favorite among Virgil’s eclogues.

JMG and all,
The idea of creation myths framing our perspective and led to things such as Classical Thought, and modern insistence on science for an answer for everything, really grabbed my attention.  Turning that insight over and over in my head has been a great source of interest.  I’ll probably keep doing so.  
It’s led me to think that our seeking of a creation myth is a habitual motion.  Many cultures, nationalities, spiritualities,   take the time to develop a creation myth and then find any number of reasons to justify that myth.  
Is this habit a perverted form of humanity?  And would it be considered evolutionary if a group of people didn’t concern themselves with a creation myth?

This section reminds me of an article I have read called “Your mind will not be uploaded)”
http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=1558
The author does not talk about consciousness but biological information processing (he is a physicist not a philosopher).
“Is there any general principle that underlies biological information processing, in the brain and elsewhere, that would help us understand what ionic conduction, synaptic response, learning and so on have in common? I believe there is – underlying all these phenomena are processes of macromolecular shape change in response to a changing local environment. Ion channel proteins change shape in response to the electric field across the membrane, opening or closing pores; at the synapse shape-changing proteins respond to electrical changes to trigger the bursting open of synaptic vesicles to release the neurotransmitters, which themselves bind to protein receptors to transmit their signal, and complicated sequences of protein shape changes underlie the signalling networks that strengthen and weaken synaptic responses to make memory, remodelling the connections between neurons.
This emphasises that the fundamental unit of biological information processing is not the neuron or the synapse, it’s the molecule. Dennis Bray, in an important 1995 paper ”Protein molecules as computational elements in living cells”, pointed out that a protein molecule can act as a logic gate through the process of allostery – its catalytic activity is modified by the presence or absence of bound chemicals. In this chemical version of logic, the inputs are the presence or absence of certain small molecules, and the outputs are the molecules that the protein produces, in the presence of the right input chemicals, by catalysis. As these output chemicals can themselves be the inputs to other protein logic gates, complex computational networks linking the inputs and outputs of many different logic gates can be built up. The ultimate inputs of these circuits will be environmental cues – the presence or absence of chemicals or other environmental triggers detected by molecular sensors at the surface of the cells. The ultimate outputs can be short-term – to activate a molecular motor so that a cell swims towards a food source or away from a toxin. Or they can be long term, in activating and deactivating different genes so that the cell builds different structures for itself, or even changes the entire direction of its development. “
That quote about seems like someone expanding on this :
“Fortune points out: “(T)here is an unbroken line of development from movement to thought. Tangential movement is a simple form of reaction. Thought is an infinitely complex form of reaction. It is a question of difference of degree, not of difference of kind”

‘New’ discoveries in science seem to validate ‘old’ understandings in magic. Perhaps just 2 different maps of the same territory? 
CosDoc seems highly compatible with quantum probability science. Fortune seems to allude to the process of how infinite potentiality (the Absolute or Unmanifest) grows into highly complex Manifest universes, minds, bodies etc. Orderly quantum states seem crucial — 3 rings, 12 rays etc in creating some sort of meaningful order. Without discrete states AND THE GAPS that seperate quanta (space, time, etc) then everything would be a non-distinct big pile of steaming brown poo.

I had a very strange experience last night. On a 13 hour plane ride, I read through the entirety of The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage, taking breaks to read other books and to try to link what I was reading to The Cosmic Doctrine. I did not sleep on the plane ride and fell asleep at my destination, very jet lagged. A few hours later, someone awakened me, and when I looked at them my mind was processing their presence through the filter of Dion Fortune’s cosmos. It was an experience I was unprepared for, but I simply made do with it and found I was able to interpret my own behaviors in Fortune’s language until I descended to reality. I have been aware since my first encounter with occult philosophy of how it shapes your thinking, but I have never had such a surprising experience of having my mind “meditating” while I was superficially acting normally.
With that out of the way, I have a comment about the relationship between the two books. The metaphors used in the books are different in ways that I don’t quite understand — seven rays instead of twelve, for instance — but some of it is familiar and intriguing. Here I should warn anyone else reading this that although there are seven planes in both books, the way of counting them is inverted and it’s not clear that the word is being used in precisely the same way, so I am being a bit experimental and rash in the following paragraph.
In the book on love, Fortune describes how conjugal union may be as shallow as limited to the seventh plane corresponding to physicality, or may extend all the way to the second plane, the first plane being primeval unity. I take it that the reason we are not immediately aware of the higher planes is because of what you describe in this post: in our capacities as Great Entities, our consciousness has gradually been built up so that we forget the deeper, simpler levels of functioning and have progressed through the planes until the seventh plane where we acquired physical bodies. So that, lacking reflection or other spiritual behavior, some people will take actions that are disharmonious anywhere above the seventh or sixth planes.
But in your thought experiment in this post, you are able to summon up our simpler levels of body-consciousness easily. And religious exercises available to everyone are able to easily recall our awareness of God, some attributes of Whom may be attributed to the Central Sun in this metaphor. Marriages can be saved through such simple work of meditation or prayer.
Why is there no similar exercise which can easily make us aware of our existence on the second and third planes? I feel like this would make things a lot easier for us. Anyway, maybe I should stick to one book at a time, but making these possible connections is very interesting for me. Writing this comment has made me aware of how much I need to read and meditate on other occult works as well as reread and contemplate this one.

Onething, no, that’s not what I’m saying, and in fact I went out of my way to point out that that’s not what I’m saying. You might consider rereading the paragraph that begins “It’s common for people to treat…” 
Phil H., delighted to hear it. 
David, those are excellent points. Fortune suggests that movement is the simplest form of consciousness, the form in which every other form is rooted; the importance of physical movement in human learning reflects that. (And I have a particular fondness for the “draw, aim, shoot” example — I ran across that research while working on my first novel, The Fires of Shalsha, and made use of it.) 
Jesuapriest, welcome aboard the magic bus! 😉 
Kay, that distinction between perfection and mastery is crucial, of course. Thank you. 
Matthias, it’s still top-notch myth! Thanks for this. 
Prizm, human beings think with stories as inevitably as we walk with feet and eat with mouths. We have to have a story to tell about how we got here, just as we have to have a story to tell about where we’re going. I don’t think it’s a perversion at all — I think it’s part of the essence of being human…and people who claim to be without a creation myth are either fooling themselves, or have lost something essential. 
Jim, fascinating. Yes, the one does seem to build on the other. 
Jeff, also fascinating. My background’s in ecology rather than physics, so I noticed the parallels between Fortune’s work and systems theory rather than those with quantum mechanics, but I’m not a bit surprised to hear that those exist as well. 
Avery, the differences between the books have to do with their audiences. The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage was written for the general occult-book-reading public, which meant most of her readers knew the Theosophical jargon of seven rays and seven planes numbered from the top down. The Cosmic Doctrine was written for an inner circle of students who could get beyond what was basically the occult pop culture of the time. As for the second and third planes, do you mean the lower spiritual and upper mental planes? There are exercises for those, and for every other plane, and the occult teachings of an older generation included all of those as basic training. We can get into that in more detail if you’d like.

As I see this thread is of a recent enough vintage to justify commenting so, I’ll say — I think there are at least a few of us out here in the aether who are following, but behind. Speaking personally I’ve meant to comment for at least two months that I’m studying and catching up with the discussion threads, about two months behind everyone else. It’s Aquarius season and I’m overwhelmed with duties, is all I can say for my failure to get a spring in my step. Hopefully by the time of actual spring…

The “draw, aim, shoot” thing is now cross-referencing in my head with the Gunslinger’s Creed in Stephen King’s Dark Tower novels. (“I do not aim with my hand; he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I aim with my eye.
I do not shoot with my hand; he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
I shoot with my mind.
I do not kill with my gun; he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.
I kill with my heart.”) They seem to be coming from opposite places, but I feel like they reach the same point–something I’ll have to meditate on today, maybe!

Hi, JMG & all:
I was fascinated with the how this week’s post treated what happens within one Great Organism when another on a different plane moves between it and the Central Stillness of the Cosmos. I went back and reread the chapter focusing on the concepts related to that. And this time through, I saw that these events are so disruptive because, in Fortune’s terms, they upset the relations between habituation and attention. 
She says early on “movements that are habitual must be maintained if an absence of distracting sensation, which is the basis of attention, is to be arrived at.”  She is saying that attention depends on the absence of distraction.
And yet, a lot of the time, success and even survival depends on one’s attention being open enough to allow unexpected things to draw our notice. And our present environment, with all kinds of broadcast and digital messages beeping, ringing, yakking at us, competing with the demands of physical reality, the demands on our attention are very great.
Later she says “The Ring-Pass-Not of a universe is the limitation of the attention of the Great Entity forming that universe. It is its determination to concentrate its attention upon the task it has set itself.”  This “limitation of attention”, this determination to concentrate upon the task one has set oneself, seems to be a lot like Will. 
In my own life, those “habitual movements that must be maintained in order to focus attention”  would seem to be my daily routines.  I considered what the routines have been and what has disrupted them—and the fact that disruptions can be either welcome or not, and either beneficial or disastrous. The factors that disrupt them have indeed felt like the intrusion of some “other world” between me and my center of gravity. Falling in love had effects in some ways comparable to the events of September 11. At such times the “laws of nature” that Fortune associates with habituation, may cease to be dependable.  
All in all, very much worth meditating upon. The Cosmic Doctrine—and JMG’s Paths of Wisdom is, as well– a book that can yield rich new pay dirt every time you go back to it.

I understand habitual actions from a different perspective than muscle memory. My understanding is that once an action (either physical, emotional, or mental) becomes habitual, that it is being controlled by our subconscious. This is in contrast to our everyday waking consciousness, the consciousness of our physical senses and the physical plane. I can take a walk for an hour lost in thought and never be conscious of the mechanics of walking. This is because while my waking consciousness is thinking away, my subconscious is doing the walking. I am therefore a being with multiple levels of consciousness (at least two).
The Cosmic Doctrine hints that there is a different level of consciousness on each plane in the statement: “As consciousness is limited in its objective functioning to one plane at a time, a unity of the innermost cannot be perceived save by the consciousness that stands therein.” This statement seems to imply that each ring or plane is associated with a different level of consciousness. So possibly, the sixth ring is the subconscious and so on up to the highest level of spiritual consciousness at the Central Stillness. 
How then does the Great Organism have levels of consciousness that would be of the different planes, like humans have different levels of consciousness, if it exists only on the seventh plane? Possibly the Great Organism had these Cosmic levels of consciousness “implanted in its nature by its experiences” when it was a traveling atom moving through the 12 rays and seven planes. These consciousness’ or movements associated with each plane then, “have become implicit in their nature and will be reproduced when they, in turn, set out upon that inner elaboration which constitutes the next phase of Cosmic evolution.” Consciousness then is memory of movement! (I guess muscle memory is a good descriptor of consciousness 🙂
Finally, our multiple levels of human consciousness are fundamentally then only a memory of the travels of the Great Organism that is our solar system. A nice thought to ponder.







 Dan Mullen says: 



								February 15, 2019 at 2:15 pm							




The last paragraph of chapter seven is interesting:
“The movement of that atom within its orbit gradually, in the course of untold ages, connects its movement with the whole, and the mass flattens out into a spinning disc; then the motions, which you saw in the formation of a Cosmos, are gone through, because the laws of motion are the same upon ever plane, and the solar system sorts out its matter into seven planes owing to specific gravity”
Since our Earth is the third planet from the Sun, the Central Stillness, we are then on the third plane out. This would mean the number five is especially important for our planet, and our planet would have implicit in its nature especially those experiences the Great Entity had while passing through the third plane in its travels. Our planet would also be especially attracted to Great Entities from the third plane as they pass by our Solar System as it revolves around the seventh plane. The number of Nature is four, the second plane out from the Central Stillness, so then Nature would be especially influenced by Great Entities traveling past our Solar System from the second plane. I’m not sure of the practical use of these ideas, but interesting ideas to meditate on.

Re the discussion of consciousness-as-motion/motion-as-consciousness
This ties in with one of the threads of conversation in the last post re free will vs determinism and one conclusion that the randomness exhibited by the Cosmos would have to be interpreted as will.  To some, this presented the “ridiculous” result that the Cosmos was conscious.
Perhaps in addition to complexity (motion as simple consciousness or consciousness as complex motion), there is also the factor of scope.  Could a component part, conscious at its own level, be aware of the consciousness of the whole on a much grander scale?  By analogy, I consider the notion of a cell in my body, aware of itself, working to maintain its homeostasis, aware of its internal state, conscious of its neighbors and interacting with them.  (“Hey there, Larry.  Got any of that ATP in today?  I’m running a bit low.”)  Could such a conscious being even conceive of my consciousness?  That is, the consciousness of its “cosmos” of which it is but one small part?  To some degree, that is the challenge we have: the scope of the greater being is so immense that we have difficulty grasping its contours.  It’s awareness isn’t like ours, so we don’t acknowledge it as such.







 James M. Jensen II says:

There’s an interesting discussion on the current open thread at Slate Star Codex about consciousness that ties in with the discussion here.
Hoopyfreud makes an analogy between “hard problem of consciousness” (i.e. the problem of why subjective experience should exist at all) and the problem of causality (i.e. what it means to say that even A causes event B rather than simply event B following after event A). Hoopyfreud argues. that rejecting the existence of a hard problem of consciousness (and thus, they seem to think, subjective experience) is like collapsing “causes” into simply “followed by.”
User 10240 responds that
When I say I don’t think there is a hard problem regarding consciousness, I don’t say that there is no consciousness, but that what we call consciousness is just an ability to perceive things, to think, and to also remember and think about our own thoughts.
User Protagoras responds that
10240 has the right answer; Hume doesn’t say there’s no causation, and those of us who reject the hard problem don’t say there’s no consciousness. Rather, the situation is that you insist that what we call causation is missing something, and that what we call consciousness is missing something. And insofar as nobody on your side has ever managed to explain in a way I can make sense of what is supposed to be missing, I find this hard to take seriously (in both the causation and consciousness cases).
I find this comment particularly interesting, because I can’t decide how similar 10240’s and Protagoras’ conceptions of consciousness are to the one presented here. (Of course, Fortune is saying something stronger than they are: namely, that all motion is consciousness, not just the motions in nervous systems that we typically associate with perception, but that’s not the point I want to pick up on.) To me, they seem to be asking for an objective description of a fundamentally subjective phenomenon before they’ll accept that there’s something their account is missing.

Apologies in advance if this is way too materialistic. I don’t have a great capacity for philosophical thought.
The easiest way for me to conceptualize a thrust-block is through physical movement.  
In ballet, the “pushing off” is highly emphasized.  It is sometimes very straightforward – you push down with the ball of your foot to go up on demi-pointe. It is also sometimes indirect – you “push off” the strength of your core, through your standing leg  and the earth, to extend the working leg. It’s not the leg in the air doing the most of the work, it’s the leg on the ground. 
I was also taught to envision a second floor – parallel to the ground at the height of my hips. With practice, you feel as if you can sit on it, which provides a mental focus for the physical strength it takes to balance.
Also emphasized is the required relaxation between exertions. You need to alternate between them, or your muscles will clench and tire. There is a constantly shifting mix of pushes and relaxations throughout your body.
All of which takes many many hours of practice, of course. You can’t read about it. Muscle memory is amazing. One of life’s richest rewards. I’ve always been baffled by the AI hype that we could recreate the brain without the body. 
Relating this concept – that movement and consciousness are the same  – to my experience with dance helps me understand it at least a bit.

OK, JMG, I did go back and read it and have a better take on it now. It seems to be saying that consciousness and movement are the same thing, which is interesting in light of the fact that nothing is every still… so maybe movement is what consciousness does.
I’m also confused about the central sun or central stillness. I would understand this to apply to the entire universe, but each galaxy has a galactic core. What are we referring to here?

“But the revolutions of Great Entities upon other planes of the Cosmos are conducted at different paces and without relation to those Entities of other planes than their own. Therefore they will pass in line with each other periodically, momentarily blocking the pull of the central attraction upon those organisms further out than themselves, and also exerting a gravitational attraction upon all particles of their own plane and planes above their own, in the mass of a great organism on an outer path. This cutting off temporarily of the central attraction upsets the equilibrium of the outer organism, removing the centripetal check upon the centrifugal force, but the tendency of certain types of molecules to fly inwards towards the attracting body tends to counterbalance this.”
Trying to visualize this image, keeping in mind that here is somehow the origin of positive evil, I got a sense of the divisive action of the other Great Entity, how it cuts off the flow of energy from the Central Stillness to our Solar System and causes some atoms to fly inwards.  ‘Inwards’ here might mean closer to center, along the path of evolution towards union with God or the cosmic energies.  Some fly outwards, which would then mean away from God, towards separateness, division.  The atoms could represent the different aspects of a person’s consciousness.  
That started reminding me of a passage in Israel Regardie’s book, The Art of True Healing, (which discusses the Middle Pillar exercise):
“How can there be depletion if vitality and cosmic currents of force pour through man, saturating his mind and body with its power? Primarily, it is because he offers so much resistance to its flow through him that he becomes tired and ill, the conflict finally culminating in death.  The complacency and confusion of his mental outlook, the moral cowardice by which he was reared, and his false perception of the nature of life – these are the causes of resistance to the inward flow of the spirit.”
So these other Great Entities or outside influences effectively cut us off from being able to perceive the flow of divine power emanating from the Central Stillness.  We may have had that awareness at some earlier point in our lives. This would clearly be an obstacle on our path of evolution.  It divides our being, creates inner conflict, clouds our inner vision from being able to perceive the great abundance of cosmic power, and sets up the wrong kind of thoughts (and thus actions).  
Some examples of the ‘confusion of our mental outlook’ come to mind, especially when thinking about the two types of positive evil.  Perverted force might manifest as greed, anger, envy, pride, excessive consumption – anywhere there is an excess.  Perverted form would be more along the lines of pathological states of consciousness like fear, self-doubt, sadness, shame, repression – anywhere there is a lack.  I’m all too familiar with these self-destructive tendencies that manifest periodically, especially in new or challenging circumstances.

@david by the lake says: “the scope of the greater being is so immense that we have difficulty grasping its contours”. That’s for darn sure. I personally feel a connection through movement – especially the simplest of barre and stretching exercises and extra especially with my favorite music. A couple of years ago it occurred to me they could be used for prayer. I started to think of the movements as a reverence (that’s the elaborate, over the top bow you see in ballet  – a demonstration of respect for your audience, or your teacher, or the pianist in class). I find it very moving –  a  connection to something bigger to whom I pay respect.
Mr Greer, you said above that “people who claim to be without a creation myth are either fooling themselves, or have lost something essential.”. I guess I would be one of those people. I get a little freaked out by certain concepts such as infinity and fractals. Trying to imagine an explanation of origin – it makes my head hurt to think about, so I don’t. What have I lost? Perhaps I should meditate on that question?

Hello, all.  I also am here,following, but somewhat behind, like Athena.
Stephania’s comment “Perverted force might manifest as greed, anger, envy, pride, excessive consumption – anywhere there is an excess. Perverted form would be more along the lines of pathological states of consciousness like fear, self-doubt, sadness, shame, repression – anywhere there is a lack.”  immediately resonated with me, especially as in TCM, one of our fundamental treatment heuristics is “fill the empty, empty the full”.  As to the Regardie quotes, there is a classical Chinese view of the “channels” (that we treat with acupuncture) that they connect the human being to the energy of heaven and earth, and are the means by which these energies may seamlessly flow.   
I will be paying close attention to the energy disruptive passages between entities described here by Fortune: “Therefore they will pass in line with each other periodically, momentarily blocking the pull of the central attraction upon those organisms further out than themselves, and also exerting a gravitational attraction upon all particles of their own plane and planes above their own, in the mass of a great organism on an outer path.”

Hi John Michael,
Out of curiosity, do you see positive evil in the resistance to change that is present in our society – even if the current circumstances lead to poor outcomes? But then if I’ve read correctly (and please be understanding if I’ve missed the point), can’t an individual react to the force of positive evil, and consciously choose to go off and do something else with their time that brings part of the whole back to a new equilibrium? Mate, this stuff is complicated…
Cheers

JMG
It is hard to be materialist about activity, especially perhaps about neurological activity. What are the ‘five senses’ and do we include the ability to sense time? My introspection – and memory – suggests that though I am conscious, I am necessarily reliant on unconscious activity making its own proper sense – like a rolling background of complex detail; some magic carpet on which I ride. 
I am not a Logos, of course, but ‘as above, so below’. Smile
And I am not reliant solely on my own activity, but must include both my conscious and unconscious awareness of entities; ‘outside’. Whether they are awake or sleeping they are beyond the immediate circumference of self. There are connections between the worlds of inference and our stirrings. ‘Did Chuang Chou dream he was the butterfly / or the butterfly that it was Chuang Chou?’ (Li Po – but see also the little verse quoted below).
What is it to ‘wakeup’? 
And I infer that my ‘unconscious awareness’ is much wider and responds to its own tunes. In my world ‘emotion’ surfaces as consciousness, an alert, awake in its own way. 
Without necessarily being conscious of the detail, living forms routinely sense autonomy, distinguish between memory and circumstance, and are aware of a world of autonomous entities, and of intention; can ‘smell’ emotion by inference.  And then there is the magic of recognition to inform us? 
I remember an analogy you made a good while back about not confusing wireless messages with the state of a transceiver. How does that analogy / metaphor stand with the Cosmic Doctrine? 
And I throw in this for good measure. A recent paper in Science on neuronal development says: “We suggest that the existence of genuine preconfigured sequential motifs at this stage is consistent with Kant’s proposal on the a priori requirement of mental constructs of space-time for the development of other cognitive faculties.” U. Farooq & G. Dragoi Science 11 Jan 2019: Vol. 363, Issue 6423, pp. 168-173

thank you for the great example. It remind me of the great Milton Erickson story of training Olympic sharpshooters with hypnosis, so that they always are relaxed and aim correctly 40/40 times, just by sitting them in chair and making sure they experience the same emotional state on the last shots (most stressful) as on the first one (the easiest).

BTW we have a thread on the Green Wizard forums in the Circle on “Critical Thinking and Mental Skills” where we are discussing muscle memory.
Re-enforcing Muscle Memory – Call and Point Safety Check
Clarebroommaker posted a fascinating take on the skill, in using repetitive actions with a bouncing ball to teach children who have difficulty with math:
I tutor kids and have had two of them who had significant difficulty memorizing their multiplication facts. For one of them, there was also lack of understanding of what multiplication even means. But their parents were really concerned that their schools were moving on without them and that they should do the memorization regardless of understanding! For both students, the “sevens” were the biggest challenge. For kid #1, I wrote the facts on a large ball. We made a game that involved answering or asking the multiplication fact after catching and before throwing the ball. When kid #1 had mastered the “sevens”, she told me things like, “7 X 3 = 21 is right here,” as she demonstrated a hard pass of the ball with two hands from waist level. Then, “7 X 7 = 49 is right here,” as she showed bouncing the ball a single time on its way to the catcher. So that may be some sort of muscle memory for math.
We are so much more than just our brains.

JMG, Red Rose Loon, and all
That creation myths are frameworks for all of us really hung me up because I’ve had a hard time with creation myths.  Raised a Christian, we were led to believe that the world was created in seven days all through the work of one god.  Modern science presented a very different alternative.  Culturally,  the USA has been trying to define it’s creation myth and what once may have been accept definitely isn’t now.  That makes sense within a civilization in decline, and that also makes sense why it’s great to get other ideas out there.  The motions, and thus consciousness we create now can help the next generations.  
On a side although not completely unrelated note, last night I heard for the first time on BBC Radio The Real Story an American professor, Ashley Dawson of CUNY who voiced the idea that the Founding Fathers had created a Republic which allowed for less Populist Democratic strength precisely because they wanted to have a society which allowed for slavery. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cswkfh  The attack against the US Founding Fathers, and thus the US creation myth has begun.

Athena, by all means take the time you need! These posts will be staying up for a good long time — I’ll take ’em down eventually, but that’s going to happen when these get turned into a book, for which I already have a publisher. The Cos.Doc. is best taken a little at a time, and there are no prizes for hurrying. 
Isabel, interesting. I read the first of the Gunslinger novels a very long time ago, and didn’t go on to the next — it was an interesting concept but I’m not a fan of King’s style of writing. That said, that’s a nice incantation! 
Jesuapriest, thank you for this! Knowing that somebody’s still doing that makes me feel a little less geriatric. 
KKA, excellent! That’s the sort of meditation Fortune was trying to elicit, as I’m sure you’re quite aware. 
Dan, good. The Great Entity doesn’t just exist on the seventh plane; it’s been on all the planes and through all the rays, and so embodies all the planes within itself. Not only that, but it gathers around itself matter from all seven planes, and so as the Great Entity imparts its own motions to the swarms of atoms, it creates a solar system of seven planes around itself. 
David, a very good point. Consider a dust mite crawling in one of Mozart’s wigs. Could it have any conception of his music, or his marital problems? 
James, I’ve come to consider all this talk about “the hard problem of consciousness” rather circular. Consciousness is the one thing we know directly; everything else — including the material objects that supposedly give rise to consciousness — we know only as experiences in consciousness. So I’d be willing to admit that there’s a “hard problem of everything else” — but consciousness? That’s like insisting that paint on the wall exists and then questioning whether there’s a wall. 
Rose, you’re taking the metaphors straight back to your own lived experience, and that’s one very good way to make them vivid and meaningful. 
Onething, we’re referring to a metaphor, of course. Don’t take this as a textbook of astronomy! 
Stefania, a good solid meditation. Thank you! 
Rose, that’s why I specified a creation myth. We can’t understand how the cosmos came into being, so we tell stories that capture what little we can understand and put it into a narrative. “Myths are things that never happened but always are,” said Sallust; if you were to think of one of the old creation myths that way, would it help? 
Chris, exactly, and exactly. Yes, it’s tough going — glad to see you’re getting it nonetheless. 
Phil H, another fine meditation. 😉
Prizm, understood. The problem with both the standard narratives of creation these days is that nobody’s willing to let them be myths — no, they’ve got to be facts in the most clodhopping sense. The sense of myth as a story through which an otherwise inaccessible reality shines, like the sun through thin clouds, is very difficult for a lot of people these days to grasp — and of course those who want to turn everything into a political weapon have no time for anything that could let in a little of that light…

I recently came across Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael and was struck by his rethinking of human evolution. Especially, the idea that agriculturalists are Takers and pre-history tribal cultures are Leavers. The agriculturalists have gained the knowledge of life and death (as embodied in the Adam and Eve story) and use that power to destroy everything and everyone that gets in the way of our producing food. This is evident nearly everywhere we go, so much so that it is now difficult to find places that have been untouched by agricultural man. Civilized vs. Uncivilized.  Progress vs. Balance.
   “But beware binary thinking”, I hear you say. So, what does the CosDoc teach me? I think of the positive and negative phases of the turning of the Ring Cosmos, Cosmic good and Cosmic evil, yin and yang. A place where it is and a place where it is not. There is duality. Yet, every pairing must have a third feature, a force that keeps them separated. The positive, the negative and the force in between. The Ring Cosmos, the Ring Chaos and the Ring Pass Not. The holy trinity, yet that basic duality remains. The dynamic force of evolution and the thrust-block of evil.

John—
So, pertaining to Fortune’s observation: “Differences of degree are reckoned along the length of the same Ray; differences in kind are reckoned in the sequence of Rays round the circle.”  Translating this into polar coordinates, the angle theta relates to differences in kind, while the radius r relates to differences in degree.  But these are discrete, rather than continuous variables, as defined by the intervals of the twelve rays (pi/6 radians per interval) and the seven planes, and within them the sub-planes, along the length of a Ray.
But what does that mean, actually?  I understand we are talking metaphor here, but where does this tie into reality?  I suppose one might ask, “what does one mean by reality?”
Also, looking at Fortune’s last sentence re universal (positive) evil as a disturbance at the outset of an evolutionary cycle which is gradually worked through, I think of the standardd differential equation “dampening” problem, wherein an oscillation is gradually reduced to stillness (like a spring) via frictiona nd other forces.  Does this translate in terms of what she is talking about?  Is evil a necessary disturbance which initiates an evolutionary cycle?  Was the rebellion in heaven and the fall of Lucifer, to put it into Christian terms, a necessary event to induce development from stasis?

Re dust mites and Mozart’s wig
I’d hope, however, that the issues with which greater consciousnesses deal are more compelling than just grand extrapolations of our mucking and flailing about here!  That possibility is just too depressing to think about.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								February 17, 2019 at 11:53 pm							




Jesuapriest, the factor that Quinn left out, to my mind, was simply the fact that his division between “Takers” and “Leavers” represents two stages in a historical process. Every human ecology starts out “taking” and then gets a clue. When human hunter-gatherers reached the Americas and Australasia, sudden dieoffs swept all three continents as the hunter-gatherers slaughtered everything they could; only later, as starvation taught them bitter lessons, did they become more sensible of the reasons why this was a bad idea. (Nor do hunter-gatherers leave natural environments anything like as unchanged as Quinn thought, but that’s a subject for another time.) In the same way, agriculture started off as a profoundly destructive force, and gradually mellowed out as people under the lash of starvation and misery figured out how to weave it into the broader ecology — and then industrialism came along and launched into the same trajectory. We’re still in the “slaughter all the mammoths” stage of industrialism, though it’s not too hard to see the jaws closing in there, too, and the ecotechnic industrialism of the distant future can just barely be glimpsed here and there. 
David, I think your first question sounds like an excellent theme for meditation; how all this fits into the universe we experience, of course, is a crucial point with any set of metaphors. As for the fall of Lucifer, yes, and in fact some occult philosophies back in the day took exactly this tack in interpreting the Biblical metaphor. 
As for higher beings, well, think of it this way. Imagine, just for a moment, that one of the dust mites in Mozart’s favorite wig was suddenly, by some sudden dust-mite equivalent of enlightenment, able to glimpse some of what Mozart was doing in his music, and in the process got some sense of just how much vaster and more intricate a world Mozart inhabited — a world not limited to finding bits of dust to eat among the strands of a wig. That’s what enlightenment is like to a human being — finding out that the universe is infinitely vaster and more intricate than we can possibly imagine…

Hi John Michael,
Thank you! The metaphor used is producing a huge blank in my mind, so I’m really struggling with these essays, but I can glimpse the concepts and overall goal and thrust of the work. It is a fascinating and also worthy project.
Maybe I spend too long immersed in a clearing in a forest, but every now and then whilst reading these essays, I get the impression that the story presented by the author could be adapted to the forest and all its various goings on forming the story. Dunno. If I wrote the story it would read like a children’s tale, but it would still contain the general thrust of the larger story.
I’m not kidding either about what I wrote in the earlier paragraph, the work is a worthwhile goal.
Cheers
Chris

Oh, man – JMG, does the Bonestell portrait of young Earth ever bring back memories! I can’t count how many times I gazed upon that painting (and all the others in ‘The World We Live In’) when I was growing up in the ‘60s. It still comes to my mind’s eye when I think of the formative stage of our planet nearly 50 years later.  
The chapter on the ‘Evolution of a Great Entity’ has definitely been my favourite so far, as it ties in so many previously covered concepts but puts them on a more familiar-sized scale. When Fortune first alluded to Great Entities earlier in the CosDoc, I was imagining that she was referring to Gods; now I see that these ‘entities’ can be interpreted in various ways. Utterly fascinating!
One comment about the whole consciousness/motion theme. As one who believes that the more subtle a thing is, the less temporal its nature, I feel that consciousness is the only constant and that manifest universes (and their motion) come and go. One of the Sanskrit words for world/universe is “jagat” which literally means “comes and goes”.
But at the same time, I fully accept that at least at the human level motion has a profound effect on consciousness. The most recent strong experience I have had of that was when I learned tai chi several years ago. Ever since then, the way that my body moves and interacts with the world has been different (much more fluid for one), but it goes way beyond that to an attitude towards “self” and “other” – and that is simply from practicing tai chi daily to the point that it became almost effortless. It has helped me a lot in my organic gardening and composting activities as well.  This experience has helped me to relate to what Fortune seems to be saying (earlier in CosDoc) that the highest-level consciousness in the universe has been learning from its experience of alternating “days” of activity and “nights” of reflection.
I’m so glad that you decided to take us all on this “magical mystery tour”!

JMG and all – 
I’m finding it very interesting in comparing Dion Fortune’s Cosmic Doctrine with the work of Jacob Boehme, the early 17th c Christian mystic and theologian. Both have Kabbalist influences (though it’s somewhat in doubt if Boehme actually ever saw a copy of the Kabbalah), both had Christian perspectives, albeit very unorthodox ones, both outlined a schematic of the evolution of the Cosmos, both stress the so-above/so-below fractal nature of the Cosmos, both employ metaphors, obviously, to get their message across, both seem to contradict themselves at times, the usual trip-wire for the overly materialist mind, both are dense, often seemingly impenetrable, requiring long periods of meditation – and both seem bottomless in their insights; return to them again and again and you’ll find a new revelation or meaning to be had. 
Boehme of course, doesn’t use modern science tropes as does DF, and he’s nowhere as elaborate in his depiction of the cycles-within-cycles nature of the Cosmos, but here’s one interesting similarity – they both describe the Cosmos as beginning with *movement*. In DF’s “scientific” description, the prime movement is of a current in space that due to the pressures of momentum and inertia, curve around to eventually form the Cosmos-enclosing Rings. Now, this is obviously a metaphor because before Manifestation there was no “space” or time, for that matter, through which a current could move. Boehme, on the other hand, seems more direct in describing the movement as somehow taking place within the endless Unity of the Unmanifest. It unravels like this – an “unequal pressure” in the Divine equilibrium came about because of desirousness “to be something”. The desire became concentrated because the Unmanifest Unity “had nothing of which it may make something to itself”, and so the Unity compressed itself into a yearning, a “magnetical hunger”. 
Unequal pressure leads to a flowing, a motion (basic physics). Thus an agitation, an “anguish” results, this due to the insatiability of the Divine desire. The anguish however, is the original source of sensibility and the capacity for feeling – out of nothingness, a somethingness has been born. Divine nature becomes perceptible to itself, and it is out of this fiery matrix that the Cosmos is formed. The Unmanifest becomes the Manifest, but it is a sublimated Manifest – because the Divine Unity is now mirrored in the mode of perceptivity, it can manifest in infinite myriad forms. 
So, just as The Cosmic Doctrine outlines the macro-microcosm scheme of the Cosmos – fromR Rings to solar logos to humans – so Boehme has his own above/below scheme, in which the original desire-to-anguish-to-manifestation/Enlightenment of the Unmanifest is reflected in our own spiritual lives. That is, through our acceptance of necessary pain and anguish, we grow in spiritual perceptivity, and we literally participate in the nothingness-to-somethingness that is the essence of Divine Creation. And that’s why it’s an error to think of our “lower self” as something to be discarded or eradicated – our lower self is rather the ground base, the necessary spark that inspires the manifestation of divine love and enlightenment. 
Of course, with his emphasis on surrender, Boehme stands as a mystic. Dion Fortune is a mage, and I suppose that is the critical difference between them. Still, between them, there seems to be plenty of overlapping themes and parallels.

John–
Re disturbances and evolution and cyclicity
Apologies ahead of time for the lament.
The challenge (or rather, one of the numerous challenges) I have is the unresolved tension of the cyclical structure.  It is a great (surprisingly emotional) knot that arises within when I contemplate this representation of Being.  Rather like a carrot forever dangled before the plodding mule, or the boulder King Sisyphus can never get to the top of the hill, we never “get there.”  We are never able to resolve the tension, fix the problems, settle affairs, come to a resolution of issues, reach the goal.  It feels like a perpetual bait-and-switch operation, where the answer keeps getting shifted to another place.
We’ve talked about the metaphors of Cos Doc in terms of US politics (the notion of the thrust-block, for example), and the same application pertains here.  We are, once again, getting embroiled in the mutterings and thrashings of the up-coming cycle; we’re debating the same issues, shouting the same slogans at one another, experiencing the same tensions, dealing with the same idiocy, uttering the same vacuous nonsense, and still not doing anything to actually fix the problems before us.  We’re some twenty months from the election and I’m already thinking, “Can we get *on* with it already?”  
If every step in the dance is only a prelude to the next step, where does the dance get you?  Why the dance?  What is the goal here?
The disturbances and continuous, unresolved tension seem like the perverse joy of someone who keeps shaking the snow-globe just as everything gets settled.  (Or again, Sisyphus losing his grip just before he reaches the top of the hill.)  It feels more like a prison sentence than enlightenment.  Peace, enlightenment, wholeness (to me, anyway) would be a *lack* of disturbances, things in their places, all tensions resolved, systems operating smoothly, known, safe, and understandable.
How is this endless irresolution “good” in any meaningful way?  Why would the Unmanifest create a trap of this nature?  Or rather, why would the Unmanifest emanate a First Principle which would create a trap of this nature?
Or am I projecting tension within onto the universe without, floundering about in Thaumiel rather than resting in Kether?

I followed book club late so some of the chapters I haven’t spent very time with. That said, I’m reading Spengler at the moment and my brain finally adjusted to his writing, so CosDoc isn’t that bad. The training-not-informing enjounder reminds me of the visualizations one makes to through a baseball with proper follow-through. No, your hand isn’t actually touching the ball at that moment but if you aren’t imagining it properly you can’t do it.
I’m finding it very easy to parse Fortune’s metaphors through the lens of persuasion and mass politics. One of the odd blessings of the current political polarization is it lets you see more about the human mind than would be possible in calmer times. Its like an earthquake that brings an unseen layer of rock to the surface so you can see all the geological strata. Now I understand why Biblical prophets spoke the way they did – if they spoke in the direct, subject verb object manner of everyday speech their ideas would be resisted by running headfirst into a preconception. I feel like there’s more to this strata idea but I can’t articulate it. Because we have groups of people with incompatible interpretations of the same facts we can see how mass minds form ideas and how those ideas exist almost as living beings, with such complexity its more accurate to describe them as personalities than philosophies. So when prophets and poets speak of these things, I can see the mundane practicality of it – once you recognize part of a pattern you are aware of the whole even if you can’t  see it. Experience tells you what to look for. Better to call that whole by a name people can visualize like angel or demon.
Fortune’s analogy of force ties so well with persuation. A force moves in a straight line. It maintains shape only when intersected at an oblique angle. This means if you see an idea sustaining itself, but you’re only seeing the main idea, you need to look further, until you find the lesser idea coming in at a weird angle. This suggests that ideas are not objects, not statics, but dynamics, always shifting. A body of ideas only maintains form when resisted at an angle. That subtle resistance guides ideas through their necessary cycle so they end up roughly where they where when you starting observing them. So this means if you can’t place an idea-form in some kind of cycle, you don’t understand and need to keep looking. But some ideas shift so slowly, so quickly, or distributed so widely amongst disparate people that they are hard to percieve. Or else the idea you’re looking at isnt being resisted and will move away from you harmlessly.
The metaphor of oblique resistance to create form implies that anything already holding form by the time you see it has already conquered any directly opposing forces. In the case of ideas that can mean the well for the anti-idea has been poisoned already. If you want to resist the idea you jeed to identy the smaller resisting idea thst gives it form, and hit that from an oblique angle. It may be hard to completely destroy an idea but maybe you can transform it into something less dangerous – neutralize it. This requires freshness. Only a fresh image or concept carries the oblique function, and won’t already be incorporated into the opposing ideas poisoned well idea defense. This also implies that all static ideas are vulnerable. For a dynamic to maintain form it must cycle. Either it must be very old, and have had time to in orporate defenses to other ideas, or utterly formless – imposssible to percieve its cycle. This implies over time all idea cycles twnd towards formlessness, or, from the other perspective, the all idea beholders tend towards slow or course perception. And that means old ideas have a tendency to create generate slow and course perception amongst the the minds that hold them.
And that’s just the first paragraph.
Ultimate stillness, stability, lack of suseptibility to influence, occcurs when all perceptions, all modes of thought, all perspectives are incorporated into a mind. When an atom has traveled each ray out and back again, when a mind or ides cycle has incorporated every possible perspective its culture, its universe, has to offer. This means your defense to persuation is a proactively open mind that interogates phenomena independant of other’s will, so by the time you are a subject of persuasion all arguments are hopeless frontal attacks.
And this last chapter gets interesting because we view the same from the perspective of the atoms. A fish doesn’t percieve the water it swins in. This relates to the revealed strata I mentioned earlier. It also means the flux of ideas that constitute one’s own cycle are largely inperceptable to oneself. The only way to open that perception, temporarily, is to expose oneself to new experience and thereby disrupt the cycle of ones own thinking. This allows you to see for a short while the patterns of your own thoughts, and determine the strong forces that define your cycle and the oblique forces that keep its form.
I am curious to see where this all leads.

David by Lake-
I’m not sure that DF doesn’t posit a “resolution”, a point at which a solar system, galaxy, Cosmos reach a complete synthesis and an “end of time”. It’s just that the end of time is not permanent. It starts again, a new dance. Sounds fun to me.
What lake, btw? Michigan?

								February 20, 2019 at 1:44 am							




@ David BTL, (if I may)-
In reflecting on your lament, I do understand your outcry about the relentless endlessness of it all, like a jukebox that someone has programmed to play the same song over and over, but it occurs to me that the goal of the dance *is* the dance. Water doesn’t nurture life unless it flows and cycles. When I return my food scraps to the compost pile, my prayer of thanks is for being allowed to participate in the cycling of energy and nutrients, knowing some day I’ll be compost too, and a compost eater. Or to tie back to (sigh) election politics, Washington wouldn’t allow himself to be made President for life- the ideas and the people representing them have to flow, sometimes rather vigorously. Lack of disturbances would mean stagnation and death. (The cartoon Christian version of heaven, sitting on a cloud strumming a hymn to God’s perfection in aeternum, always seemed more like a punishment to me, an eternal time-out.) Or to tie back to the post’s original content, if movement is consciousness, wouldn’t a lack of tension mean the end of consciousness? The stillnesses are there, it seems to me, the rests in the rhythm, but overall the song goes on because… it’s the song.

Re my previous
I need to learn to not post when I’m feeling frustrated with the world, which tends to cause me to say dumb things and ask questions I already know the answer to.  (Answers I don’t necessarily like, mind you, but certainly that I already know.)
The (painfully slow) work continues…

Understood.  As I mentioned above, I made the error of posting at a moment of particular frustration with things, taking positions I know to be invalid (e.g. that there is ever goal in the teleological sense, or that the point of the Dance is anything other than itself).
With re to the lake in question, yes, I’m a handful of blocks from the Michigan and can hear it quite clearly from our back deck when the wind is up 🙂

Hi, JMG,
I took the time while you were having a break to catch up on the Cosmic Doctrine so I could pick up again when the discussions started anew.  I am glad that from now on there can be a full month for me to contemplate a chapter—it takes me 3-4 times through to feel I am understanding what is happening and to be able to move on.  I made my first reading of chapter 8 today and had to smile at this sentence: “This digression which, strictly speaking, belongs to another section of this subject, is made here to ensure clearness of comprehension in the argument pursued” as I am not sure at all yet the concepts of this chapter are made clearer to me.  In contemplating the beginning of the great entity, I felt a little stirring of memories from when I was very young, and felt connected to the sense of growing consciousness.  I still have more passes through the material to get to enough understanding to continue on next month, though, and the discussions here I have found very helpful with that.  
I did have a strange thing happen to me, though, after reading this month’s chapter.  I have moved on to Paths of Wisdom after four very slow years of going through Learning Ritual Magic.  In my first reading of the descriptions of solar and etheric charging, my thoughts were, “How in the world can I do those when I live in an apartment complex with no outdoor space of my own and so many people wandering around watching what I do?” But reading today, I put the Cosmic Doctrine down, and the thought that sprang into my mind was, “Of course I can do solar and lunar etheric charging and I will.”  It is strange how the contemplation of this book seems to help me in my practice in ways that seem quite strange to me.

“Every emotion starts out as a motion, and only later is internalized as an inner perception.”
Applying this principle to cognition more broadly reminds me of Julian Jaynes’ notion that language preceded consciousness as we understand it. Essentially he argues that humans didn’t develop the perception of an inner space in which their thoughts arose until they had become accustomed to using that metaphor to discuss the minds of others.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Creation of a Universe 
March 13, 2019March 13, 2019John Michael Greer55 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 9, “The Creation of a Universe,” pp. 44-47.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 8, ‘The Relation of a Great Entity to the Cosmos,” from page 61 to the end of Chapter 9, ‘The Projection of the Concept of the Universe,” p. 66.
Commentary:
To understand the material in this chapter, it’s important to remember one of the crucial points made in last month’s chapter: the concept that motion and consciousness are two ways of talking about the same thing. When one pool ball hits another pool ball and the second ball moves in response, that response is akin—in a very, very simple way—to what happens when an idea enters your mind and interacts with the ideas already in place there. Is that a metaphor? Of course; everything in The Cosmic Doctrine is a metaphor. As we’ll see, though, it’s a metaphor that has a great deal to teach.
This is especially important to keep in mind as our text shifts focus from the Cosmos as a whole to the individual solar system we live in. As the protagonist of our tale gradually changes from traveling atom to Great Entity to Solar Logos—or to say the same thing in different language, as we move from that entity’s relationship to the Cosmos, through its relationship to the solar system it creates, to its relationship to those beings who inhabit that solar system—the metaphors Fortune uses change gears from physics to astronomy to psychology. Those are all ways of talking about the same things, but “the nearest approximate metaphor” changes as the context changes. It’s well to keep that in mind, to avoid the sort of fundamentalism that fixates on the words and loses their meanings.
With that in mind, we plunge at once into the inner brooding of the Great Entity. That being has gone spiraling outward to the seventh Cosmic plane to take up an orbit there, and swept along with it a vast number of other atoms of all seven basic types. It does this while the Cosmic cycles are in their negative or destructive phase. Why? Because it’s in the destructive phases that a settled order is shaken apart and change becomes possible. Once this is over, the Great Entity sorts itself out—we can think of this in terms of movement, as the vast and intricately tangled pattern of “tracks in space” that form the Great Entity settling into a stable equilibrium, or we can think of it in terms of psychology, as the Great Entity brooding over what it has experienced in its long pilgrimage through the Cosmos.
It doesn’t brood over the Cosmos. The Great Entity is entirely unconscious of the Cosmos, in much the same way that you and I are unconscious of the deep processes of our own minds. The Cosmos forms the foundation or, as Fortune says, the conditioning background of the Great Entity. What the Great Entity broods over, rather, is itself. It becomes aware, not merely of this or that sensation within itself, but of itself as a whole. (In terms of motion, we can describe the same process as the achievement of a state of equilibrium in which every motion balances, and is affected by, every other motion.)
That act of self-knowledge brings a universe into being. That’s easy to say and just as easy to misunderstand. Remember that in The Cosmic Doctrine, consciousness is movement, and everything that exists is space moving. The universe that the Great Entity creates is a pattern of movement in space, set in motion by the intricate movements of the Great Entity itself. The pattern of movement gathers up the atoms that have accompanied the Great Entity out to the seventh Cosmic Plane and begins to move them the way the original traveling atom was moved by the great wheeling currents of the Cosmos.
The universe brought into being by the Great Entity’s knowledge of itself isn’t static. While the Great Entity isn’t directly aware of the Cosmos, it is aware of changes in its own state that are caused by the great Cosmic tides. So the Great Entity comes to know itself as a being in time, changing in long slow cycles as the Cosmic tides shift, and changing also in less predictable ways as other Great Entities on other Cosmic planes sweep past in their own orbits and briefly come between our Great Entity and the Central Sun at the heart of the Cosmos. All these changes become part of the Great Entity’s understanding of itself, and shape the pattern of movements in space that surrounds the Great Entity.
The Great Entity is therefore, in Fortune’s words, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe it has brought into being. It is the god of that universe, if you’re a monotheist, or the chief and parent of the gods if you’re a polytheist. Druids in the Revival tradition who work with the Cos.Doc. thus tend to identify the Great Entity with Hu the Mighty, and the tale of his leading the Cymry from Deffrobani to the Island of Britain with the Great Entity’s journey from the Central Sun to the seventh Cosmic plane; readers who prefer other myths and other theologies will likely have no trouble finding something suitable to their needs in their own tradition’s resources.
To say that the Great Entity is the god of the solar system is to court certain misunderstandings, and Fortune does her best to confront those. Is such a god infinite and omnipotent? From the point of view of the universe it creates, sure, because from within that universe the Great Entity defines and shapes everything there is. From the Cosmic point of view, though, the Great Entity is finite and subject to Cosmic conditions; from the point of view of the Unmanifest, meanwhile, the entire Cosmos and everything in it is a pipsqueak phenomenon not worth noticing.
In the space around the Great Entity, though, are the atoms of all seven Cosmic planes that the Great Entity swept along with it as it went out to the seventh Cosmic plane to take up its orbit. Like the Great Entity, these atoms are complex vortices of movement in space, born of the same Cosmic processes as the Great Entity. Unlike the Great Entity, though, they haven’t done the rounds of the Cosmos, moving through the Rings and Rays and absorbing every Cosmic influence from every angle. Think of them as the wallflowers of the Cosmos, waiting nervously for someone to invite them to dance. That’s what the Great Entity did, and now they’re dancing with it, pirouetting around it as it makes its more dignified way around the inconceivably vast arc of the seventh plane.
Those atoms will take on considerably more importance in our narrative as it proceeds. One thing that Fortune mentions a little later on may make them a little more interesting right now, and that’s the far from minor point that you, dear reader, are one of those atoms.
More precisely, the essential spiritual core of you is one of those atoms. Just as the Great Entity started out as a single atom and became a vast and intricate structure of movements in space (i.e., of consciousness) over immense ages of evolution, you started out the same way and are heading in the same direction. The Great Entity is the creator of the solar system in which we exist, the parent and great conditioning force of that solar system, but at the heart of each being in that solar system is something that has its origins in the Cosmos. The Solar Logos is in Fortune’s view not our father but our elder sibling.
(It’s probably worth taking a moment here to remind those of my readers with strong theological opinions that nobody is required to believe The Cosmic Doctrine, in the sense of “believe” normally heard in churches. The Cos.Doc. is not a scripture. It’s a set of metaphors designed to teach certain ways of thinking that are otherwise very difficult to grasp. I’m fairly sure that Fortune did believe that the metaphors of The Cosmic Doctrine were true, to the extent that any statement that can fit inside a human mind can be said to be true, but I’m just as sure that she didn’t make a fuss about that. If you believe other things about God or the gods, bracket Fortune’s claim as a misplaced metaphor; the rest of the story works just as well if you identify the Great Entity as a mighty angelic being, for example.)
Let’s take a moment to follow the Cosmic atom that became you as it moves through the first phases of its existence. Like the traveling atom that became the Great Entity, it came into being in the seething cauldron of forces at the center of the Cosmos, but its basic geometry was such that it drifted out to one of the seven Cosmic planes and stopped there, settling into an orbit while the traveling atoms were preparing for their great adventure along the Rays. For ages it circled around, absorbing the influences of the Rays passively, until finally the Great Entity invited it to dance and the music started to play.
As the Great Entity settled into its orbit on the seventh Cosmic plane and began to bring itself into conscious equilibrium, so did the atom. Since the atom had been through a much narrower range of experiences, that process was much simpler, but your atom and all its companions ended up with their own modest bits of self-knowledge, or to put the same thing another way, their own sets of tracks in space, laying out the range of reactions possible to each. If you like, you can think of the individual atom as the very first and simplest form of soul, and the pattern of reactions in space surrounding it as the very first and simplest form of body.
So we have the Great Entity brooding over its experiences, and the individual atoms that have accompanied it doing the same thing, forming a vast cloud surrounding the Great Entity; and we have the thoughts of the Great Entity becoming movements in space, and drawing the atoms of that cloud into patterns of motion (and thus of consciousness). Since the only thing in the consciousness of the Great Entity are patterns of movement/consciousness that came from the Cosmos, the Great Entity’s brooding draws the cloud of atoms into a replica of the Cosmos.
So seven planes appear, each one stocked with atoms drawn from the corresponding Cosmic plane—the first plane with atoms from the first Cosmic plane, and so on out to the seventh plane with atoms of the seventh Cosmic plane. Each of the planes divides in turn into seven sub-planes; these are called Regions in the Rosicrucian teachings from which Fortune seems to have derived some of her cosmology, but we’ll stick to her term here. Each sub-plane represents one set of possible reactions on the part of atoms of that plane, and—since substance in The Cosmic Doctrine is always and only movement in space—as the atoms of each plane act out those reactions repeatedly, they create substance.
From this point on, as a result, it’s necessary to draw a distinction between the original atoms of the seven Cosmic planes, on the one hand, and the patterns laid down by their movements within the solar system, on the other. Fortune calls the first set Cosmic atoms, reasonably enough, and uses the bare term “atoms” hereafter for the latter. A little later on, as the Cosmic atoms take up their role as the spiritual essences of beings otherwise composed of ordinary atoms, the Cosmic atoms will get another name: Divine Sparks.
The Divine Sparks ultimately belong to the Cosmos, not to the solar system in which they dance. They are younger siblings of the Great Entity, and while they dance in the pattern the Great Entity’s brooding sets in motion, that’s not the only force that influences them. That’s where the idea of the Great Entity as an infinite and omnipotent god becomes complex, because the Great Entity may be infinite and omnipotent in terms of its solar system but it’s not quite either of these in relation to the Divine Sparks.  They know nothing outside the solar system, but they are still influenced by the background of the Cosmos.
Each Cosmic atom, to be specific, is influenced by the Cosmic plane where it orbited for all those ages, and when Great Entities of that plane come close, the Cosmic atoms that came from that plane are affected by it. Thus the Divine Sparks or Cosmic atoms aren’t simply puppets of the Solar Logos, the Great Entity at the heart of their solar system. They have their own independent reactions. At times they will contend with the Solar Logos, and the Logos will contend with them—and out of this intricate fabric of contention, compromise, and ultimately cooperation, the solar system takes shape and seeks its destiny.
 
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on April 10. Until then, have at it!

John–
A thoroughly challenging yet rewarding endeavor this is turning out to be.
Obviously, careful reading to be done still, but to make sure I am on track here, you are saying that our spiritual essences are Cosmic atoms (aka Divine Sparks) while our bodies (and I’m thinking also our habits, thought patterns, etc) are the “bare” atoms which are the tracks in space of the Solar System.  Am I following this correctly?
Secondly, for whatever reason, the idea of the Cosmic atoms being early in the process which leads to the Great Entity (“you started out the same way and are heading in the same direction”) brought to mind the LDS doctrine (or one-time LDS doctrine, I don’t know if it still held) whereby the believer achieves godhead over some dominion.  I think it was Brigham Young who developed that doctrine, IIRC.  Something like “what we are, they once were; what they are, we will become.”  (Rough paraphrase from memory.)

David, yes, our spiritual essences are Cosmic atoms aka Divine Sparks. Our various bodies — physical, etheric, etc. — are formed out of the other, secondary kind of atoms. As for the Mormon doctrine, well, were you aware that Joseph Smith studied Cabala with a Jewish teacher for some years? He was very well versed in Western esoteric tradition. (I’m hoping that someday the LDS will get back to its roots, and a splendid new renaissance of esoteric thought and practice will burst into being in Utah…)

John–
Re Joseph Smith and Cabala
Fascinating!  No, I was not aware of that.  Rather casts a completely different light on my (admittedly partial) understanding of LDS history.

Some very interesting ideas, and I thank you for the time you’ve put into the essays. 
I’ve been contemplating movement and consciousness a lot lately and their relationship to time. Have you read tertium organum? Do you any thoughts on it or how to approach it?
Regarding your essay last week and machines, I was wondering if you were familiar with the idea of extended phenotypes? The idea of the cosmic atoms evolving is making me think that it may be describing a similar idea from a different pov. And then I start to wonder, working backwards, if her atoms are another way to describe genes.
Last question, do you think it is possible that Dion Fortune was not describing a system as much as she was teaching how one can come up with a system. That is to say, teaching not how to read the map, but how to make a map.
Thank you again for your time and efforts.

“… a splendid new renaissance of esoteric thought …” seems unlikely in my neck of the woods even given the archaeological legacy of our Neolithic predecessors; those monument builders just down the road from here … but who knows?
I am minded just now of Robin Carteret’s work at the memorable 2014 London Conference. His illustrations of the swirling flocks of social birds collecting at their winter roosts were beautiful reminders of the collective interactions of autonomous ‘sparks’. Robin also got some of us into a circle with a simple instruction for movement. When he stopped the chaos, we were roughly distributed randomly. When however he changed just one part of the instruction for the next movement session, we ended in distinctly non-random distribution. 
Got me thinking at the time, and seems for me a possible intro to this month’s contemplation.

Hi JMG
As the divine sparks are atoms gathered from  each plane as the solar logos travels outwards, each would carry their original movement with it as being a three, four, five etc sided trajectory. That basic characteristic is there before the divine spark is gathered up and pulled outwards by the solar logos, so does this give some kind of inherent independence or self will?
Following that thought if we are the divine sparks do we  have  differing  three, four, five etc sided trajectories in our make up, or are we all the same type of atom having ended up on the outermost plane?  I am tempted to ask what this might mean, but I can hear you telling me to go and meditate on it.
CosDoc work always makes me feel like my brain has been twisted inside out then given a good shake. I have really come to enjoy that feeling.

I’ve been following this journey with growing interest, unfortunately not having the free time to follow it in detail.  This week’s post, however, triggered several thoughts in my mind.  I offer them here in the spirit of “for what value you may find” in them:
* “Because it’s in the destructive phases that a settled order is shaken apart and change becomes possible.”  brought to mind  C.S. Holling’s Adaptive Cycle (see https://www.resalliance.org/adaptive-cycle).  Could that model be usefully related to what’s being expressed here?  (By the way, https://www.resalliance.org/panarchy extends Holling’s model to multiple levels.)
* Might there be analogies to David Bohm’s Explicate and Implicate orders?  (See for instance https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/david-bohm-implicate-order-and-holomovement/.  The site’s explication of nonduality seems to be consonant here.)
* This model of consciousness is the first I’ve seen that properly distinguishes between individual and “global” consciousness, and relates them in a meaningful way.
* ” I’m fairly sure that Fortune did believe that the metaphors of The Cosmic Doctrine were true, to the extent that any statement that can fit inside a human mind can be said to be true…”  Would the statement that “All models are false, but some are useful” apply here?  (Understanding “false” not to be taken too literally).  And of course, “the map is not the territory”.
* The “evolution” of the atom in response to the forces acting on it, and the invitation to dance with the Great Entity, reminds me of Nietzsche’s saying: “One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.”
* ” [individual atoms] forming a vast cloud surrounding the Great Entity”: a cloud of unknowing?
* “At times they will contend with the Solar Logos, and the Logos will contend with them…”.  Heraclitus: “contention is the father of all things”.  As I recently learned, the Greek word he used was “polemos”.

The tracks in space = consciousness reminds me of something I remember reading in the 70’s, possibly in an out-of-print book entitled “Getting There Without Drugs:”
https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0670337633/ref=olp_page_2?ie=UTF8&f_used=true&f_usedAcceptable=true&f_usedGood=true&f_usedLikeNew=true&f_usedVeryGood=true&startIndex=10
If we could step out of the Space-Time continuum and look at our lives sideways or from above, they would resemble 4-dimensional worms with the length represented by our time on earth and a kink or squiggle whenever we go from one place to another.
The author described the worm as having your body at the head as it is today, and your entire past trailing behind you–But I’ve since thought that, from that perspective, we’d see the entire life from beginning to end as a single worm.
CosDoc really is a wonderful metaphor that seems to link up and integrate a lot of my random thoughts.  Thanks again for taking this one on, JMG.

1. In what sense do you use the terms universe and cosmos? The great entity we are discussing, which appears to be the sun, brings a universe into being by its self awareness. Yet I would have thought that the universe already existed and is synonymous with the cosmos.
2. Who or what is the author of the cosmos?
3. You mention a central sun at the heart of the cosmos. But that would seem to skip over the galactic core in the hierarchy.

David, John Brooke’s The Refiner’s Fire: Magic and the Making of Mormon Cosmology and Michael Quinn’s Early Mormonism and the Magic World View are two very good sources for the esoteric sources of some of Joseph Smith’s thought. 
Docshibby, yes, I’ve read Tertium Organum, but it’s been a long while, and the Fourth Way isn’t really my thing. I’m not familiar with the concept of extended phenotypes, but will look that up as time permits. As for Fortune, why, as she explained at the beginning of this project, the point of this exercise is to train the mind, not to inform it…
Phil H., it sounds like a very useful source of metaphors. 
Pogonip, thanks for this. 
Zebby, good. Yes, Fortune’s metaphor has it that there are seven distinct kinds of Cosmic atoms or divine sparks here in this solar system, with internal geometries ranging from three-sided to nine-sided. We aren’t all the same — though that doesn’t mean that one kind of us is better or worse than the others. 
Dwig, hittin’ em out of the park. Yes in all cases. Serious fodder for meditation there!
Emmanuel, I like that. I recall a science fiction story that had the four-dimensional worm-shapes as a plot element. 
Onething, first, Fortune does not use the term “universe” as synonymous with Cosmos; it’s another term for the solar system. Second, in Fortune’s metaphor, the Cosmos has no author; it emerges out of the processes we explored in previous chapters. Third, when Fortune wrote, nobody knew yet that there was more than one galaxy; the metaphor — and of course it is a metaphor — still works.

JMG, could you recommend a book or article that discusses Joseph Smith and the Cabala teacher? This is the first I’ve ever heard that-even Richard Bushman’s biography of Joseph Smith doesn’t mention it. (I should note here that Bushman, while a Mormon, is fairly liberal and extensively discusses other controversial things about Smith, like polygamy.)
Granted, it would make a good deal of sense though-I was a baptized Mormon for three months (long story) and some aspects of the Mormon conception of God are very reminiscent of Western Esotericism. 
The quote David BTL was looking for is “As Man now is, God once was, as God now is, Man may be.” It was first said by Lorenzo Snow, second or third Prophet after Brigham Young, and is still discussed within Mormonism. Gordon Hinckley (LDS Prophet in the 1990’s) was asked about it by a news reporter once, and his answer was one of the most impressive examples of dancing around a question that I’ve ever run into.

Hi John,
Inspired by this blog and the Cosmic Doctrine I am diving into 19th century literature preceding Fortune, hoping for an easier going.
So I read Rudolf Steiner’s “Philosophy of Freedom” in my mother-language.
The principle of monism seems for me to be the principle to go with.
Somehow this train of thought starting in the German Romanic somehow got lost in the 20th century.
So here we are picking it up again.
In the end consciousness and not material seems to be fundamental.
If we could connect energy with consciousness, we would be at E=mc2.
This would connect my materialist worldview I lived with for 50 years with the romantic one.
For me as an engineer this is quite a step to go, but happy to be there.
Thanks a lot for your inspiration luring me into this topic.
As you said, it is quite a ride.
//Bernhard

I am thinking about our universe and God as a great entity. If i understand correctly God would be described in the cosdoc system as this great entity, creating the material universe through introspective selfawareness, but is He then encapsulated in this seventh plane of a Cosmos ”outside” of the universe? 
Does that same Cosmos then contain other great entities? Are there more Cosmi? (…cosmes? Cosmoi?) 
I’m squaring it with actual worldview by quantum gradient multiverse

“You will perceive that a Great Entity comes out from the Central Stillness and takes its place upon its appointed circuit, and conducts its organisation under the influence of the negative or destructive phase of the Cosmos, and this may seem strange to you, that creation should take place under the influence of a destructive phase of the Cosmos, or any other organisation which, by overbalancing the synthesis of forces achieved in a phase of evolution, causes them to embark upon a fresh phase of development in order to re-establish their harmony; and as they commence this phase with the experience of the preceding phase implicit in their nature, they commence where the last phase ended.”
That passage made me think of the idea of ‘challenge, response and integration.’  So you’re living your life, minding your own business, and then something happens to you, an outside stimulus affects you.  This is the initial ‘force’ phase.  You don’t really understand what’s happening at first.  Then you think about the situation, try to wrap your head around it, and then choose to respond to it in a particular way. You limit the possible reactions to one (thus destroying the infinite other possible reactions), which is the moment something new is actually created in your consciousness.  This is the ‘form’ phase, the point at which you understand it.  Finally it becomes integrated into your being and you reach a new state of balance or harmony, a new normal, and you carry on as before but with an expanded way of looking at and responding to the world.
That reminded me of Binah, the Great Mother of the Kabbalah, which means ‘understanding.’ Binah is the Womb which responds to the impulse (force) of Chokmah, giving birth and thus form to it. 
A very simple example of this might be found in Athens and Sparta, the two more famous ancient Greek city-states, who responded to the challenge of a growing population and a lack of fertile land in two different forms:  Sparta by hyper-militarizing their society and taking land from other peoples by conquest; Athens by changing the nature of their economy from purely subsistence to export and manufacturing, (developing democracy as almost a by-product of their citizens having some of their time freed up).  
Challenges are how we learn and grow or evolve.  All those many fracking learning experiences which cause us to struggle and suffer and grapple with life are what shape our beings. As a child grows up and learns through experience, so do the various universes, and Cosmos, learn and evolve as well.  “They climb upon its shoulders.”

Greetings to JMG and intreptid readers:  
Reading and rereading this chapter of CosDoc left me feeling like I was trying to untangle spaghetti. When I sat down to pin down the nature of the conundrum, it centered around my lack of clarity about  the process of Creation as Fortune depicts it:   
She characterizes the creation of the universe as an administrative act, an act of mind and will, rather than the work of a craftsman.
Yet, the “body of God,” –that “unorganized mass of units” that God organized into a Universe– is credited with “the first act of creation.” It includes the “divine sparks”, which had already organized themselves and possess their own self-images and consciousness, but needed God to organize them in the aggregate, so that they could organize their interrelationships and “create” the atoms of the sub-planes.  
There seems to be a deliberate avoidance of drawing a distinction between mind and matter in this metaphor of creation.
Even the very simple atoms have been  credited with assembling and organizing themselves—out of secondary forces and tensions set into play by the movements of the primordial cosmic movements—rather than popping into existence at divine command. 
So, what is “Creation?” 
 Is it essentially this building of reactions into patterns and structures, from the ground up? 
Or is it the act of consciousness that recognizes  the patterns and then projects them?  
What is the relationship between the consciousness that acts, reacts, and forms patterns, and the consciousness that recognizes patterns and manipulates them? 
After scratching my head over this for some time, I am left with a conclusion something like this:  
Consciousness and the objects of consciousness are like the chicken and the egg. They are functions of one another. Trying to separate them, trying to make one prior to or dependent upon the other is to land yourself in an inextricable morass. 
I’d be interested to hear if anyone else had a better insight on this business!







 Onething says: 



								March 14, 2019 at 2:30 pm							




1. Oh!
2.  So then does she address the origin of existence at all? Would you say that in this system the cosmos arises out of the unmanifest? So I guess what I am asking is, What is the unmanifest or -?
3. Why yes, I had forgotten that! I think for me I would imagine the galactic core as the great central sun but knowing that there is another, fractal, layer up that encompasses the entire universe as a whole. Meaning universe in the modern sense as the sum of all galaxies.
“Onething, first, Fortune does not use the term “universe” as synonymous with Cosmos; it’s another term for the solar system. Second, in Fortune’s metaphor, the Cosmos has no author; it emerges out of the processes we explored in previous chapters.

Tolkienguy, I read about Smith’s Cabalistic studies in an academic journal of the history of occultism back in the very early 1990s. I believe I have the issue somewhere, but it’s probably in a box in the back of the closet; I’ll see if I can find it. 
B3rnhard, delighted to hear it — I’ve got two good English translations of that book of Steiner’s, and find it well worth many readings. You’re quite correct that the monist approach got misplaced over the course of the 20th century, and badly needs to be recovered. 
Ten, the word “god” has more than one meaning in Fortune’s vision. For us — beings inhabiting this solar system, composed of one Cosmic atom embodied in atoms of this solar system — the Great Entity is god. For the Great Entity, and the uncountably many other Great Entities in the Cosmos, the Central Sun is god. We experience the Central Sun and the other Great Entities only through the Great Entity who is our Solar Logos — “none cometh unto the Father except by me” — but beings in other solar systems have their own Solar Logoi, and beings in the Cosmos outside individual solar systems turn to the Central Sun directly. 
Stefania, excellent! A fine meditation on a theme from this chapter. You get this afternoon’s gold star. 
KKA, good. You’re grappling with the challenge that Fortune is setting you. You’re quite right that she’s refusing to accept the standard, and unproductive, distinction between mind and matter; thought is movement, and substance is movement, and the logical conclusion is? Equally, there’s no difference between the consciousness that knows and the things it knows — these are two poles of a single act of knowing, and come into being out of the act of knowing, rather than being prior to it. 
The thing to keep in mind is that the ways of thinking Fortune is trying to teach you really are a massive challenge. That’s why it takes all this complicated apparatus of imagery and metaphor to communicate it. My advice? Don’t worry about untangling the spaghetti. Follow her advice — build up the images in your mind and then move through the ideas one at a time, relating the concepts to the images. That way you develop the capacities that enable you to think like a mage. 
Onething, she discusses the origins of everything in the first chapter. The Unmanifest is impossible for us to understand, or even to contemplate, except through the metaphor of empty interstellar space. Movement in a void: that’s the first thing we can even begin to grasp, and imagining fractal levels above that just pushes the mystery back a step — you can go on in an infinite regression, with Unmanifests emerging out of Even More Unmanifests which appear in turn out of Really, Truly, Super-Duper-Unmanifests and so on. Fortune instead simply draws a line at the point where we stop being able to say anything meaningful about the subject.

“This may seem strange to you, that creation should take place under the influence of a destructive force of the Cosmos, or of any other organisation which, by over- balancing the synthesis of forces achieved in a phase of evolution, causes them to embark upon a fresh phase of development in order to re-establish their harmony.”
Not that I understand a great deal about computers, however, it makes me think of binary machine switches and how the binary code understructure is common to all computers, from simple to hyper-complex.  The creative force is the number one but it is nothing without zero, the destructive or limiting force.  The basic zero-one collection of a few primitive on-off switches (the computer in its infancy) evolved to become my iMac, a machine that represents layers of complexity piled on to that original binary code.  
Hope this makes sense.

@Bernhard RE: Matter derived from consciousness–
Thomas Campbell wrote a trilogy of books on this topic entitled, “My Big TOE (Theory Of Everything)” .You may find it interesting!  
He describes our bubble-universe as fully derived from a ground-state consciousness which connects all of us, down to every quark in every grain of sand.  It is a lot like the CosDoc in many ways, but written more from the point of view of a physicist who travels the Astral planes and dabbles in Asian philosophy.   Aside from the occasional snarky comment, I thought it was well worth the read.  
It should be available thru any well-stocked library, but here’s a link for the full title and ISBN if anyone wants it;

Hi JMG,
I don’t know that this is the right place, but I am a bit confused by the seven planes and which bodies humans have formed. 
I think I read somewhere (but could be misunderstanding) that souls start on the first plane, the spiritual plane, and proceed to create bodies on the different planes as they evolve, eventually able to form a body on the seventh plane, the physical plane. But I also recall that humans are in the process of creating a fully formed mental body. 
Can you help straighten this out?
Thank you

Some really great and thought provoking responses. A couple observations:
1) Stefanie – your explanation of the metaphor is very clear. Thank you, It reminds me of Hegel’s thesis, antithesis, synthesis idea. I need to learn more about Kabbalah, I have minimal knowledge of the system.
2) KKA – Your thoughts on object and subject are similar to one of the primary ideas crucial to the Buddhist understanding of existence, Pratītyasamutpā, roughly translated in English as dependent origination. I would try to explain more but my mind barely grasps the idea and I don’t have the means or words yet of communicating my thoughts on the matter.
JMG – speaking of the the above, can you recommend a book or site on sacred geometry. I suspect visual aides can help me clarify my ideas to be able to better communicate them.

Could you comment further on the paragraph at the bottom of Page 46 and top of page 47 where Fortune discusses the Great Entity’s limitation to the “stuff” of its component orbiting atoms in the creation of its self-projection?  Is she saying that we (or our spiritual selves plus the tracks of mental/physical selves) are, in part at least, what the Logos of our system is composed of?  Or am I missing a distinction here?

This is a really fascinating chapter. Creation of a Universe happens in a discreet order. First are experiences, for the Great Entity this is life as a traveling atom. After appropriate rest and settling down upon its place in the Cosmos, the Great Entity contemplates those experiences to create an understanding of itself. This contemplation happens between the time of death and birth, so is not part of physical plane objective consciousness. The Great Entity then projects out a thought form of itself, which attracts the appropriate atoms to itself that correspond to the experiences the Great Entity had while traveling throughout the Cosmos. Once the thought form is populated by atoms, it then becomes the objective aspect of the Great Entity. This objective aspect sounds like a physical body. However, I am not sure if we are at the level of the physical plane yet when objective aspects are mentioned here, but it seems we are close, since objective consciousness generally refers to that of our five senses of the physical world. 
So at a personal level, each of us is a thought form created by our individual Souls between incarnations that reflects the experiences of our past lives. The person we are and the individuals and experiences we attract into our lives to populate this thought form are how we “know thyself.” We both attract atoms to our thought form to create our individual Universe, and because we are individual atoms ourselves, are attracted to and populate a greater thought form that is resonate with our individual one. 
This process of how atoms populate thought forms to create Universes also explains the limits of imagination. I can take pieces of my Universe and with imagination put them together in new ways, such as create an elephant with wings. If I then project this thought form out hoping to create such a being, nothing happens. This failure of creation is because there are no atoms that exist that can populate the thought form of a flying elephant. No atoms have ever had that experience and created a thought form of it. Thus, my creation can only exist on the subjective plane and never materializes on the objective, material one. I wonder, however, if the atoms in my Universe do in this lifetime experience my flying elephant on the subjective plane, so that in a distant future life, such a being could come into existence? (Be careful what you wish for. 🙂 )

@docshibby if also makes me think of the extended phenotype. 
For anyone interested, it’s Richard Dawkins’ hypothesis he hopes to be remembered for – which can be read in the small and elegant The Extended Phenotype. Too bad the Islamophobia and sexism overshadow his personal brand, because it’s one of those scientific theories that when paired with Hollings’ Panarchy essentially mirrors western esoteric thought, giving “rational” support to earth spirituality in general, without the author conceivably even knowing it.
Essentially, it is the mechanism for group selection that is still argued against by individual sexual selection purists – except Dawkins is able to show that it doesn’t just apply to species groups, but entire biotic and abiotic communities.
Take the example of the gene for “building a dam” in beavers. Traditionally, we would then have a diversity of dam – building behaviours that would be the phenotype, the expression you can see, of that gene (this is obviously simplified, it’s assuredly more than one gene). But the thing you can also see to know “dam building beaver gene” is present is the dam itself. But not just the dam, but the dozens of species specifically adapted to living in beaver ponds, and living in the forest around a hungry beaver’s lodge. So the bitter sap of the aspen deterring the beaver’s gnawing is also, in a way, a phenotypic expression of genes located in a beaver body, as is the changed size and foraging behaviour of the fish. As is the entire beaver flood landscape.
It really has to be read in Dawkins’ own words.
I’m meditating on Beaver itself as the destroyer and builder of ecosystems, the new stability that the forest settles down to think about when they’re done… How each species brings itself, but the beaver gene changes some aspects of how they live, within a new equilibrium. And how the “non living” parts undergo the same changes and adaptation in response on different scales and time periods. Ties nicely into the other series of posts on invasive species.

This week really took it to the next level for me! I’ve been enjoying this series since the beginning, and I think in this chapter it started to really sink in just how deep and significant this book is. The relationship between the Great Entity and the Cosmic Atoms especially is something I plan to meditate on. Our elder sibling, created from and subject to influence from the much wider cosmos just like us? The implications there are incredible, and I look forward to them being developed more. I may be jumping ahead here, but is this where reincarnation comes in for the cosmic atoms? Is reincarnation how they obtain all of the cosmic experiences that they didn’t get before being swept along with the Great Entity? Thanks again for guiding us on this journey!

Hi John Michael,
I assume that the cosmic sparks get pushed by the winds and at the same time pulled by gravity? And that as the orbits of the divine sparks brush against the Great entities interesting things can occur? And exercising free will can be a bit like swimming against (or bending slightly with) the tides for the cosmic sparks?
Cheers

								March 16, 2019 at 8:43 pm							




I keep reading/studying these chapters.  In this case, I’m trying to reconcile the notion of the divine sparks with the Buddhist notion of “no self.”  It’s always a question in Buddhism of how to reconcile the doctrine of rebirth with that of no self.  I can’t say I’ve ever seen it done satisfactorily.  I’ve got to keep reminding myself that Fortune’s text is metaphorical, not literal, to train the mind rather than to inform it.       Any thoughts?







 SpiceIsNice says: 



								March 16, 2019 at 10:52 pm							




Hmm, heavy stuff. So basically, the Great Entity doesn’t create anything new (in substance), but simply pulls and pushes on all the atoms within its sphere of influence. All of which is according to an intricate plan based on the long travel they underwent of being pushed and pulled by other atoms/currents of motion. But of course, that’s precisely how substantial new things are created: motion interfering with motion creates an expanding amount of increasingly intricate new patterns. And all of us atoms aren’t simply being swept around by the Great Entity, but we’re being invited to merge with the Great Entity’s long history of motion and contribute to the continued creation of new intricate patterns of motion.
Whew, hope I can add something meaningful to this vast neverending project eventually. 🙂
So JMG, what would your universe look like if you were a Great Entity? A lot of OSS stories tied together + some shoggoths maybe?

 SpiceIsNice says: 



								March 17, 2019 at 3:51 pm							




@phutatorius
The Buddhist doctrine of rebirth is basically that one flame is used to lit another flame, but the two aren’t exactly the same flames (if I’m remembering correctly). The metaphor Dione lays out actually maps perfectly onto this flame metaphor, since Dione explains that all substance is motion, so you, me, all the atoms, etc. are a pattern of motion. Through the cycle of life, death and rebirth our pattern of motion evolves through its interactions with other motions.

@Onething
I’m pretty sure the Sun/Solar Systems from the metaphors aren’t meant to match up with what we call the Sun/Solar System in the physical universe.
Though with the Unmanifest, Central Sun/Stillness, Cosmos, universe/Solar System, Solar Logos/Great Entity etc. I’m thinking a spreadsheet would be handy about now. 😉

Kimberly, it makes a great deal of sense. The binary digit 1 means nothing without a 0 to give it definition and context. 
Matt, the planes in which human bodies form are the sub-planes of the seventh Cosmic plane. There’s a complete set of seven sub-planes in this solar system, each of them further subdivided, and those are the planes on which our involution and evolution take place; the Cosmic planes are the vast frame within which our solar system and everything within it exists. Does that help clarify things? 
Pogonip, glad to hear it! Thank you. 
Onething, that reminds me of the lecturer who claimed that he would unscrew the inscrutable. 😉
Docshibby, sure. I recommend starting out with Miranda Lundy’s excellent little book Sacred Geometry, and proceeding from there to Robert Lawlor’s Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice, 
David, we, plus the tracks in space we lay down, are the raw material from which the Great Entity creates its universe, which is also in some sense its body. The Great Entity itself is something else again — an immense, intricate, equilibrated structure of Cosmic forces — but it takes its solar system as a body in roughly the same way that you and I take a new body at the beginning of each incarnation. 
Mike, sorry to hear about your friend! That’s got to be rough. I’ve also just learned of the death of a friend, for what that’s worth — the guy with the scythe never takes a day off. 
Dan, a fine meditation on Fortune’s theme! You and Roger Dean have a common thoughtform, for what it’s worth…

Scotlyn, thanks for this! 
Andrew, got it! You’re in the competition. 
Kwo, exactly. It’s by embodying themselves in the worlds of the solar system, which the Great Entity has made as a reflection of the Cosmos, that the Divine Sparks undergo the same kinds of experiences that made the Great Entity what it is, and so the Great Entity is their initiator and teacher. 
Chris, three for three. Exactly!
Phutatorius, well, let me ask you this — what is a self? The divine sparks aren’t personalities, they’re centers of motion/consciousness that have developed certain habitual reactions. Is that a self? 
SpiceisNice, yes, basically. If I were a Great Entity, well, my universe would start out much like the Cosmos, since that would be the basis for all my experiences and thinking. I’d definitely put shoggoths in it, though, and more inhabited planets. Oh, and tentacles. Lots of tentacles. 😉
Onething, remember that all this is metaphor…

Thanks, JMG. It sounds like the planes are fractal or self similar. It also sounds like we will get to humans in due course.

On the Tree of Life, would the original line that bent into the cosmos be perydd? In which case I am thinking muner would be the local great entity for us, and the sun his physical manifestation in the sphere of naf?

Your reply to Phutatorius got me thinking – could it be said that the Great Entity is the Higher Self of the Solar System, and the divine spark is the Higher Self of which I am the projection?

Hi, JMG,
The quote from this chapter that I am meditating on is about the great entity: “It is therefore fully conscious, for consciousness is but awareness, and awareness is but a reaction to stimulus.”  I think it stood out to me because I have been ruminating on consciousness (subconsciously) ever since the discussion on consciousness as a development of all complex systems in your post “The worlds we live in”.  I will probably be meditating on consciousness for some time, and especially the consciousness that resides outside of humans.
I form the picture of the great entity slowly becoming aware and contemplating…and I am reminded of two early memories of developing my own consciousness.  They are both from when I was six, and going to first grade at Catholic school.  The first was coloring a picture of Jesus in school, and contemplating, “Who or what is God?” and the second coming home from school, lying on the couch and seeing three dots on my stomach—and contemplating, “What are these and why are they here?” not realizing they were the beginnings of a nasty case of chicken pox.  And I imagine the great entity looking at the divine sparks and thinking “what are these and why are they here?” or thinking on the great stillness and thinking “who or what is god?”
Does Fortune’s metaphor extend to speaking of whether all humans are the same type of atoms from the same planes or different types from different planes?  And what about the other consciousnesses around us?  Sometimes (especially as I am reading the Cosmic Doctrine) I feel like a three-sided atom from the first plane lured out to the seventh plane by the attraction of an entity further along the same path I would like to follow…..
(Apologies–posted this comment to the “Worlds we live in” post by accident, as I had it open in a different window to reference it.  I’m not sure if you can just not post it to that post.)

Phutatorius – My understanding of the Buddhist “no self”, based on Nagarjuna’s writings, is that it is not that there is “no” self, just that there is nothing permanent about the self. The “self” is always changing, always in flux —- Always moving to use Dion’s metaphor. Now admittedly, there are many different schools of Buddhism, so some may have different interpretations. Nagarjuna’s logic is one that I respond to. 
Another set of Buddhist teachings that I respond to is Dzogchen, which at its core, and please forgive the massive simplification, is striving to see reality as it truly is…the five lights — a form of movement. 
Impermanence is everywhere.
My own seeds of understanding are that energy must move. Movement requires/creates space and time (these three things are one and the same and originate together – perhaps the first “trinity”?). Movement/Space/Time inevitably leads to life and consciousness. How exactly that happens, I have no idea, but I am intrigued by recent physics studies that Jeremy England has been compiling. https://www.quantamagazine.org/first-support-for-a-physics-theory-of-life-20170726/
I could be very wrong in my understanding, but to meld Professor England’s ideas with Dion’s metaphors, the periodic elements and chemicals are the planes that a spark passes through in its journey to start life. The theory seems to state that life exists to dissipate energy – the more complex that life is, the more energy it dissipates. Why we are needed to this, I have no idea – perhaps the universe is one giant heat sink for a super advanced species.

Re my previous comment, answering a question with a question is a method approved by the Buddha himself – that is, if he had a self.  The Equinox is approaching, and I’d guess there’s some analogy with CosDoc there; entering a phase of expansion and new birth.  And, though I don’t know the mythology surrounding St. Patrick, I just noticed that his day just precedes the beginning of that growth phase.







 Cliff says: 



								March 19, 2019 at 4:51 pm							




Another thought – consciousness is movement, but there’s a Great Stillness at the center of the Cosmos. This would imply unconsciousness, but all the various atoms in the Cosmos moves through it at some point. So is this like the Cauldron of Annwn, a great still reservoir of unconscious soul-stuff that emanates the various sparks on their journeys? Or is there an order of consciousness at work there that I’m not yet seeing?

Phutatorius and Docshibby (if I may),
In the wider South Asian context where the Buddhist no-self teaching first appears, the various Hindu philosophical traditions take it as a matter of definition that self just means the eternal, and therefore unchanging, core of each person, whatever that might turn out to be. Indeed, different Hindu schools describe that unchanging eternal core very differently from each other, and their internal debates tend to use arguments along the line of “(fill in the blank) is subject to change, therefore it can’t be the self.” For the present conversation, the point is simply that saying “everything is always in flux” precisely amounts the denial of any self as everyone in classical India defined that term.

I haven’t been contributing to this discussion simply because my family’s esoteric views on these questions seem to me to be fundamentally incompatible with Fortune’s system, at least to the best of my understanding.  But I might mention here that for us, there is no such thing as a single personal Self for any human being anywhere on the planet, much less one that naturally progresses through successive incarnations.  Every human body contains a multitude of Selves, some of which never wake up during the life of that body.  Others can be woken up by uncommon actions (for example, in Spiritualist-style séances or trance-work or various rituals).  Yet others take turns waking and sleeping.  Some of these Selves are so nasty or dangerous that it would be unwise ever to wake them up; others are their polar opposite.  None of them really survive the death of the body, but bits and pieces of them are transmitted to one’s descendants (not exclusively by biological inheritance), who also gets bits and pieces of the Selves in the other parent as well.  One consequence of this theory seems to me to be that there is no progress for any human toward any sort of a better and brighter spiritual future.  
For us, reincarnation is possible, but not the only option: extinction or eternal stasis in some disembodied state are also possibilities.  With sufficient skill, one might be able to choose; but one’s choice really has no cosmic significance whatever.  And these possibilities seem to apply to one or another individual Self, not to the whole congeries of Selves in any given person.
To the best of my knowledge so far, this view of the multiplicity of perishable Selves in every person comes from 19th-century Spiritualist speculations and especially from 19th-century psychical research, notably Frederic Myers’ work on subliminal selves.  
Whether it is a true of a false view, I do not know; but this is my view by inheritance.

response to Robert M.:  Your family’s esoteric views agree pretty well with what I read in Alexandra David-Neel’s little book “Secret Oral Teachings in Tibetan BUddhist Sects,” especially on pages 101-103.  I especially like her comment, “It is not only famous persons … it is also obscure cobblers, the humble farm workers who no one seems inclined to claim as having been ‘himself’ during his former lives.”

Hi Barefoot-
I appreciate your reply. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think the notion of “self” that you refer to is atman. I am not as familiar with Vedanta philosophy, but it is my understanding that on this particular point, Buddhism, especially Mahayana, Chan and Zen, diverges greatly from Hinduism and to lump all “no-self” ideas into a one bucket is not just a simplification, but a mistake. 
Again, I admit my knowledge of Vedanta is limited, but I was under the impression that atman is an eternal, unchanging “self” that we all share, whereas in Mahayana Buddhism, the “void”, “emptiness”, or “no-self”, is the idea that there is no true static “essence”, that the self is constantly in flux. I think its a very important differentiation.
I am not saying one is right and one is wrong. Not to mix metaphors or philosophies, but I think this is one reason why my own personal leanings are more towards Taoism: The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.

One of my dear friends is fond of saying, when former lives are being discussed, that she was a litter-box scooper in a temple of Bast in ancient Egypt.  It seems to be a discussion-stopper, or so she says.

Docshibby,
Actually, I’m referring to three quite different Hindu traditions:
(1) the ātman of the Vedānta schools. For non-dual strands of Vedānta, which are the most commonly discussed, the eternal, unchanging self is ultimately identical with Brahman, the absolute reality… and there is only a single such reality. (Other traditions of Vedānta get way more complicated, so I leave them aside for now.)
(2) the ātman of the Nyāya (and Vaiśeṣika) schools, according to whom there are a great many distinct selves. These selves are classified as substances, in just the way that atomic particles of fire, air, water, and earth, as well as larger material objects (pots, tables, human bodies) are substances. Like all the other substances, selves are the bearers of various qualities: in the case of more material things, think shape, color, smell, etc.; in the case of the selves, the qualities include pleasure, pain, thoughts, and more.  And like the atoms (but unlike the medium-sized objects built out of them), selves are eternal and unchanging. Their qualities/properties change, but they themselves continue as the very same thing.
(3) the “person” (puruṣa) of the Sāṅkhya school, which is arguably the oldest surviving material in Hindu philosophy. This tradition is radically dualist: the person is a perfectly passive witness which quite literally never *does* anything at all, while matter (prakṛti) is active, constantly in flux, dynamic and changing. The fundamental mistake from which you need to be liberated, according to this tradition, is thinking that you are matter.  You’re not, never have been, never will be.  You’re a “person” who is eternal, unchanging, and always separate from that.
So, all three of these Hindu traditions have very different ideas about the self, but they share the idea that, whatever it is we really are, that thing must in some sense be eternal and unchanging.  The Indian Buddhists reject this.
For a fairly rigorous introduction to all of this, I recommend Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought, by Richard King. It’s scholarly but not overly challenging; I’ve assigned it as a textbook in introductory college courses that I teach on these topics.
(I’ll not be checking this comment thread much more, but you can reach out again at the next open post, or contact me through my dreamwidth page, if you want to continue this conversation.)

This post within the siblings section made me tear up a bit before I had chance to think about it. I guess I’ll need to ponder that reaction a bit. (it wasn’t the bad kind… more like a… I dunno… sehnsucht might be hitting close to the right emotion..)
And given that I still swim in Christian waters with my AODA life-vest on I’ll have to think on the Stations of the Cross this week along with the Three Circles of Manifestation… 
Anyhow, thanks for your time helping us through this material!

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Beginnings of Consciousness 
April 10, 2019April 10, 2019John Michael Greer40 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 10, “The Beginnings of Consciousness,” pp. 48-51.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 10, ‘The Relation Between the Projected Image and the Logoidal Consciousness,” and Chapter 11, “Auto-Reactions and Cosmic Memory,” pp. 67-72.
Commentary:
This month’s section from The Cosmic Doctrine goes further along the path sketched out last month—the trajectory that leads from one set of metaphors based on physics to another based on psychology. It’s an unfamiliar route in today’s world, for two reasons. First, our habitual way of dealing with knowledge is to break it up into separate sciences, so that – to borrow one of Buckminster Fuller’s jokes – nature has to call an interdepartmental meeting any time a kid throws a stone into a lake, to figure out how to resolve this unwarranted intrusion of one discipline on another that proceeds from psychology through anatomy to physics.
The point of the joke, of course, is that divisions between sciences have to do with the limits of human understanding, not with the thing that’s being understood. Psychology and physics exist in the same world, subject to the same characteristic observed sequences of events that modern materialist thinkers like to call “natural laws.” At least in theory, it should be possible to start from either science and move step by step to the other, making only the changes required by shifts in complexity or scale.  That’s exactly what Fortune is doing in this section of The Cosmic Doctrine; having built up an elaborate set of metaphors relating to motion in space, she shows how increasing complexity gradually transforms motion into mind – and, of course, vice versa.
That’s where we enter into the second source of unfamiliarity, because the gap between physics and psychology, between matter and mind, has been turned into a no man’s land full of smoking craters and barbed wire by centuries of bitter quarrels between science and religion. For a long time, it was standard practice in the Western world to split the cosmos down the middle, handing the material world over to the scientists while turning the world of subjective experience over to the clergy. It’s the attempt to overcome this division and claim the whole of existence for one’s own that drives the efforts of scientific materialists to insist that mind is “nothing but” something matter does, if mind exists at all; the same attempt drives the efforts of Christian fundamentalists to insist that the Bible ought to be treated as a geology textbook.
One of the things that makes occultism so controversial in today’s society is that the subject matter of the occultist is the realm where physics and psychology impinge on one another. To be an occultist is to deal with the places where mind affects matter and matter affects mind – where a symbolic image held in the mind and filled with emotional energy can make things happen in the world of outward experience; where the positions of the stars at the moment of birth reveal an individual’s character and destiny; and so on through the roll call of the occult sciences.
It’s not unheard of for occultists to engage in the same sort of imperial thinking as scientific and religious fundamentalists, and try to impose occult explanations on the whole of existence. That’s why H.P. Blavatsky’s first big book, Isis Unveiled, spends one thick volume lambasting the science of her time and another lambasting the mainstream religions of western Europe and the Americas. (Her critiques didn’t age well, which is why even among Theosophists you won’t find many people who’ve put a significant amount of study into Isis Unveiled.)  More often, the occultists of Fortune’s time placed their discipline in the gap between science and religion, and tried to maintain good relationships with both sides – an attempt that got no more encouragement from either side, to be sure, than it does today.
By and large, this latter approach was Fortune’s way of dealing with things; that’s why she encouraged her students to study the sciences and to participate in whatever religion made sense to them. (She practiced what she preached; she published books on psychology and soybean cultivation, and most Sundays you could find her at her Anglican parish church.)  The Cosmic Doctrine, though, took a subtler tack. By presenting metaphors for meditation that move elegantly from physics to psychology, she provided a mental toolkit for bridging the gap between mind and matter without trying to impose any one set of explanations on either. That, to conclude this somewhat lengthy prologue, is the project that this month’s text is meant to further.
We are dealing at this stage in her cosmology with the mind of the Solar Logos, the god of this solar system, whose physical body is the Sun and whose aura embraces the planets. This is a metaphor that reveals much, though readers who don’t have the kind of occult training Fortune’s students got may need some help following out its implications. In occult teaching, the aura or Sphere of Sensation is a roughly egg-shaped body of subtle energies that surrounds the physical body. It’s the body of consciousness, and its outer surface is both the sense organ by which we perceive patterns in consciousness and the organ of action by which we create such patterns and radiate them outwards for others to perceive. (In modern English, we confuse these two processes by lumping them together under the single word “imagination.”)
The solar system is the aura of the Solar Logos. It is the screen on which the influences of other Logoi and of the twelve great Rays of the Cosmos are projected. So – and this is where the metaphor becomes extraordinarily useful – everything Fortune says about the relation between the Solar Logos and the solar system is also being said about the relation between your consciousness and the realm of images and ideas reflected from other minds or created by yours.
So we begin with some developmental psychology. The Solar Logos, remember, has settled into its orbit on the seventh Cosmic Plane after aeons of journeying, and the atoms swept up with it in its outward journey form a vast formless cloud around it. The Logos and its companion atoms all go through the various changes and reactions possible to them in their new setting – think of it as settling into a new neighborhood, meeting the neighbors and figuring out where to shop and what pub’s going to be your local from now on, and you’ve got a decent metaphor for this process – but the companion atoms, being much simpler than the Logos, get settled in much faster and then begin a process that’s going to play a very large role in what follows.
Fortune’s term for this process is “epigenesis.” Another term for it, which Fortune also uses and which expresses one of its core aspects very well, is “play.” The companion atoms have finished settling in long before the Solar Logos has finished brooding over its experiences, and so they find ways to fill the time until the Logos begins to act on them. That’s the first phase of Logoidal evolution – the creation, by the Cosmic atoms, of new possibilities through play – and it’s also the seed from which free will, in a certain nuanced sense, eventually unfolds.
The second phase of Logoidal evolution happens as the Logos reflects on its experiences, and those reflections shape the cloud of companion atoms around it. Since the Cosmos is what the Logos has experienced, the solar system (Fortune, like the astronomers of her childhood, calls this “the universe”) is drawn into the image of the Cosmos, with seven Circles or Planes surrounding the Logos and twelve Rays streaming outward from his solar body.
The third phase begins as the Logos begins to reflect on the solar system around it. It has been conscious of the Cosmos, and then of itself; now it becomes conscious of its surroundings; the differentiation between subject and object now shapes its awareness; and since its broodings are reflected outward into its aura, the Cosmic atoms that form its aura reflect this, and begin to perceive themselves as subjects and other things as objects.
This is an immense shift. Think of what you experience when you wake up out of a dream. You move from a state of consciousness with no center, in which “you” can mean a dozen different things in as many moments, to a state in which your own consciousness becomes the center of your experiences. You become a subject, and other things become objects; that allows you to know the things that surround you, but it also allows you to know yourself. That’s what happens in the third phase of Logoidal evolution.
It’s important to remember that none of this takes place in a vacuum. We’ve already learned that as the Solar Logos and its companion atoms move in their orbit, they’re affected by the forces of the twelve Cosmic rays, and also by the influences of Logoi on other planes. Once the Logos has awakened to objective consciousness, it is no longer directly aware of these things. They become the exact equivalent of the subconscious influences that affect each of us, and work their way out into the brooding of the Logos and the answering movements of the solar system in exactly the same way that subconscious influences on the human mind reflect themselves first in our thoughts and feelings, and then in the events we experience around us.
Since the Logos isn’t deliberately repressing the influences of the Cosmos, though, they work their way into consciousness in a roundabout fashion – the same way, in turn, that each of us can come to terms with our own subconscious patterns. A Cosmic influence shapes the brooding of the Logos, and causes certain modifications in the solar system; the Logos perceives these, reflects upon them, and integrates them into its own understanding of itself and its solar system – in words Fortune borrows from the Book of Genesis, it “sees that it is good.” This is the process by which the great creative periods take shape: the Days of Creation in Christian esotericism, for example, or the periods of geological history understood by science.
Implied here, of course, is the idea that the Solar Logos learns and grows. It is the god of its solar system—we’ll see a little later on where the other beings worshiped by polytheist religions come from and how they relate to the Logos—but neither it, nor they, nor any other being in Fortune’s vast metaphor, exists in a static condition of perfection. Everything is learning, growing, exploring new possibilities.
The Cosmic atoms are also learning and growing. Like the Solar Logos, they are conscious of the patterns of tracks in space they have created around themselves, and of the similar patterns that other Cosmic atoms have created around themselves—we call these patterns, in their present extremely complicated form, “bodies,” and call the tracks in space that form them “matter.” At first that consciousness is of a very simple form, like the bodies that are its objects, and both grow more complex as the solar system ripens. We’ll get to that in future chapters.
Notice, though, that the Cosmic atoms or Divine Sparks are not conscious of the Solar Logos. Instead, the Logoidal consciousness becomes the subconscious background of the newborn minds of the Divine Sparks, in exactly the same way that the Cosmos forms the subconscious background of the Logoidal consciousness. As the Divine Sparks ripen and engage in further epigenesis, they will each develop a personal subconscious, but the Logoidal consciousness remains as the deeper background to their acts and awareness. If you want to borrow a turn of phrase from another occultist with a strong background in psychology—yes, that would be Carl Jung—you can call these the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious respectively. The implication, as Jung and Fortune would both have agreed, is that the collective unconscious that humans experience is identical at its deepest level with the mind of God.
But what is this thing that we’re calling “consciousness”? It’s to Fortune’s credit that she does not try to dodge this difficult question. She starts by pointing out that consciousness does not belong to the Cosmos; it is not a reaction of the Cosmic atoms in and of themselves; it does not originate from and return to the Logos. It is a modification that affects the Logos and the Divine Sparks, and it is the first such modification that comes into being as a result of conditions in the solar system as distinct from the Cosmos. It is, to be precise, a matter of tracks in space.
Tracks in space, as my readers will doubtless remember, are how the Cosmos got started in the first place. The same principle gives rise to the solar system as we experience it, but there’s a difference, of course. The tracks in space that gave rise to the Cosmos were set in motion by the movement of empty space itself; the tracks in space that become a solar system are set in motion by the movement of Cosmic atoms, whether we’re talking about the immensely complex Cosmic atom who has become the Logos of the solar system or the far simpler Cosmic atoms who were swept up in the outward movement of that Great Organism. It’s all tracks in space, but within the context of a solar system, there’s a point to drawing a distinction between tracks in space that have a Cosmic origin and tracks in space that originate within a solar system, as a result of the actions of things that have a Cosmic origin. That distinction is in fact drawn very often; we call things of the Cosmos by the term “spirit,” and things of the solar system “matter.”
Between these lies a third kind of thing, which also originates within the solar system and is also a matter of tracks in space. A Cosmic atom reacts to something, and that reaction leaves a track in space that continues to flow even when the Cosmic atom is doing something else. That ongoing flow is memory. As reaction follows reaction and more tracks in space are formed, memories flow together into patterns of pure movement that we can, without too much confusion, call “thoughts” and “images.” Over time, the Cosmic atom or Divine Spark develops a rich network of movements in space surrounding it, expressing all the potentials for reaction that Divine Spark has gained.
So we have the Divine Spark, or spirit; the network of tracks in space surrounding it, which is mind; and the specific repeated movement patterns the Divine Spark acts out at any given time, which is body. It can be helpful to try to imagine these in some simple form—say, a Divine Spark as a single point of light tracing out the pattern of a triangle repeatedly, going from angle to angle to angle and around again, while all around the point of light whirl the faint tracks of other possible motions the Divine Spark isn’t making just at that moment. The point of light is spirit, the tracks whirling around it mind, the triangle body. Then imagine yourself as a far more complex version of the same thing: a glowing point of light, which is your spirit; a whirl of possibilities tumbling through your consciousness, which is your mind; and a pattern of movement which has swept up billions of other, smaller lives—the cells of your body—into its dance.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on May 8. Until then, have at it!

Saw this on Facebook, which I know you don’t do. Thought it might relate to your work on temple construction as magical art.
Enjoy.

You weren’t kidding when you said Cosmic Doctrine is “heavy going”, JMG!  My poor brain is doing some major calisthenics just to grasp a morsel of this discussion.  
Pertaining to the subject-object relationship, I am trying to analogize it by dumbing it down and thinking of myself and my house.  Not that I built my house with my own two hands or anything — I doubt I could successfully erect a mud hut — however, if I playact with myself in the role of “Logos”, then I project my own image onto my house, which I have consciously imprinted with my consciousness.  For example, my house has a couple of gardens, a thrifted couch, one of my guitars, my husband’s attic man cave, etc. that are of course within certain parameters I prefer.  The house itself is not aware of me (though this is the part where I get confused because the house has lots of spirits and energies who in essence imbue everything within it, including the gods the SOP has me invoking) but I am certainly aware of it and the creative process that enabled me to live here and that I made it happen.

JMG, what is relation between astral plane and Sphere of Sensation? Isn’t imagination (as an active force), operating in large part on astral plane like you explained in the Infinity Path podcast[1]? Is it an unique construction of Golden Dawn tradition? And original metaphor from Dion Fortune?
Also, the image of the divine spark racing in the track of space, every movement reinforcing existing memory/patterns have so many implication for microcosmos – if Will is expression of Divine Spark, how far we can consciously shape all the cascading patterns, take the different path through space (and time on material plane). We can also track the change from the will through imagination through action and back – and see how it is important to anchor change (even symbolically as ad-hoc ritual) in psychical, astral and mental plane at the same time.  
[1] to every reader here, those podcasts are worth listening to, if you don’t keep with our illustrious host second site.

Rita, thanks for this. Not sure about the website but the researcher they quote, Paul Devereux, is very competent — one of the experts in the field. I’ll have to chase down what he’s written on the subject. 
Kimberly, good. The beings that are aware of the Logos come a little later in the process. 
Dan, got it. Thanks. 
Changeling, the sphere of sensation or aura is etheric, but it reflects the patterns of the astral world. Imagination does indeed have its effects on the astral plane, through the medium of the sphere of sensation — and no, this isn’t a unique teaching of the GD or Fortune, it’s central to modern magic generally, and appears first (as far as I know) in Eliphas Levi.

John–
Only tangential to the chapter, but certainly provoked by it and by your commentary.  You mentioned Isis Unveiled as a less-lasting work and I found myself reacting very strongly to that, not because of the work itself (of which I know very little), but rather a sense of frustration with this occult landscape more generally.  I am standing in the midst of a vast, unknown territory.  I have all of these various maps that have been drawn by various other explorers, but maps of varying quality and in different languages and using different keys.  I am near-sighted and hard-of-hearing, so my own senses are of little use.  How am I supposed to manage a trek across this terrain if I can’t tell which maps are good and which are nonsense, I can’t see or hear the land for myself, and even if I could discern the quality of the maps, I can’t reconcile the “good” maps into any kind of  coherent over-all picture of the land?
I recalled the comment you had Owen make in WoH #3, that he could spend his entire life studying the Necronomicon  and still not have plumbed its depths to a great extent.  The territory is so vast that I cannot possibly understand it to any meaningful degree. 
After sitting with this for a while yesterday, I realized that I was in some ways complaining because I wished to drink all the water in Lake Michigan and that task was proving to be overwhelming.  Well, perhaps the decision to attempt that task is the source of the problem…
So, I came back to accepting (if begrudgingly) the limitations of this finite existence and making what headway I can, even if it will be vanishingly small in the grand scheme of things.  
Now, back to studying.

Hi, JMG and commentariat. I have uploaded a short story for the Love in the Ruins anthology (deadline May 1). For anyone who is interested in reading, it is to be found here: https://rageagainstsauron.blogspot.com/
Regarding this month’s post on CosDoc, I’m loving it! I find the chapters about the ‘solar system’ much more stimulating and relatable than the preceding chapters. I also love the fact that Fortune depicts the Great Entity / Logos / Solar God as evolving entity – much more in line with polytheistic depictions of gods as interacting with other gods and “learning” in the process, rather than the monotheistic God who has always been omniscient and omnipotent (which if interpreted as the consciousness of the entire universe I don’t dispute as being possible, but is at a degree so far removed from our feeble minds that a God beyond all dualities is practically incomprehensible). This rhythm and flow of day/night, expansion/dissolution, activity and introspection, and how a being evolves due to these dualities – rather than experiencing a senseless repetition of these cycles – fits so well with the lives that we experience. 
In Indian culture, an art form or philosophy that is very rich but very difficult to penetrate is referred to as a “coconut”. CosDoc sure is one ripe coconut – thanks for cracking it open for us, JMG!

Wow, that’s incredible. I’m actually kind of raw after reading your explanation. Or maybe it’s the journalling that I’ve just begun that’s left me emotionally open.
I’m going to build up a physical analogy of my own here, if you’ll bear with me.
If we were two dimensional beings, a three dimensional being would see us like we see a shape drawn on a piece of paper, or like we see a paramecium as a two dimensional shapes when we look at it swimming around on the slide of a microscope. If you were to take horizontal cross sections of my body and print them on transparencies, each slice would look like a two dimensional being. If we stack all of the cross sections (printed on transparencies) up in the right order, you would be looking at a three dimensional image of my body, encased in a box of clear plastic.
To get an idea of what I look like in 4 dimensions (3+time), you would need to take a series of photographs from a fixed place, say 100 feet above the precise center of my house, and again print them on transparencies. If you stack all the transparencies on top of each other and look at them from above, you would see me swirling around my house very densely, less densely around my garden and yard, and even less densely around my neighborhood. If the resolution of the photos was really high, you could see cells and other material entering and leaving my body, along with water, and air.
If the resolution was atomic, and you could see matter as it was–mostly empty–instead of how our eyes have learned to interpret matter, then you would see clouds of protons and electrons, really dense around my body proper, and diffusing outwards into the clouds that represent other people, animals and things. If you traced all the matter that came and left my body out to it’s source and destination, tendrils of me would radiate outwards into all the other objects on the earth, but there would be an extremely dense cloud at the center–my center–around which you could still draw an arbitrary border and call it me.
Expand that analogy into the ethereal plane, astral plane, etc. with energy and ideas entering and leaving, and you have a picture as complex as anything I can even imagine the ability to imagine.
So, thank you John. You swept me up into your cloud about 15 years ago with the incisively logical Archdruid Report, back when I thought the “Archdruid’ part was an ironic gag. Thanks to every one else as well. I didn’t start reading the comments section until a few years ago, internet comments being what they are, and have found your ideas and questions mind opening as well. Mind blowing is more accurate, and I don’t use the term at all lightly. It’s been quite a ride.

Hello JMG and fellow commenters,
I would also like to thank you for guidance through this most complex text.  I know I would only be getting a fraction of what I am otherwise.
Also, in reply to David’s comment about the sheer volume of material to learn once one begins to look orthogonally to the conventional view: I know how you feel.  Some days it is like I’ve opened the closet to get a shirt, but instead found Narnia.
So, John Michael, this is evidently skipping ahead a little, but this thought came to me while I was reading the text and I wanted to put it out there.  If the Logos is capital “G” God, whose mind is the backdrop for all that occurs in our solar system, then the lowercase “g” gods would have to be found among the most complex of the other cosmic atoms swept up by the pre-Logos in its travels through the Cosmos.  Since the text indicates that these atoms continue to evolve as a result of their interactions, this yields a model that seems to have a good fit with the concept of reincarnation, your divine spark having experiences in this life which are encoded in patterns of movement, then built on in future lives.  This also suggests that the evolutionary step from conscious animal to spiritual being is some sort of state change of the divine spark, like from liquid to gas, because of the qualitative difference between those life forms.  
One more thought.  Other stars then, are other Logoi.  The reason then, as far as we can tell, that these other star systems are similar to ours (on the material/scientific level) is because these Logoi are born of the same Cosmos as ours, and took similar paths.  Hmm.  Now I am wondering about the spiritual significance of black holes, neutron stars and other stellar remnants.  I can see the beginnings of a pattern, but I will not go down that particular rabbit hole right now.
Thanks again!

Finally all caught up!  Felt good about it for a solid minute, until this month’s reading resulted in far more questions than answers.  Every effort at filling in the gaps leads me down seven rabbit holes that have seven subrabbitholes. I accept it’s just a matter of time and persistence, which wears down all things, including rabbit holes.  
It isn’t so much this month’s reading gave rise to the questions, exactly, but rather that as time goes on, the questions in the blurry background become sharper.
Among them: Is she going to lead us toward the idea of the planets as spirits/gods?  In that vein, what about human interactions with the spirits/gods? How do their astrological effects on us fit in with them as spirits/gods influencing events on Earth?  Is she leading us toward being able to comprehend them being all of these things simultaneously? Should I learn about the seven planes outside of CosDoc, or is that going to be covered? (I probably will anyway just because it’s becoming increasingly necessary to do so to understand what the planes are, these are just questions that have arisen.)  
Still, rather than obsess on what I can’t figure out yet, I’m going to take a moment to celebrate the breakthroughs –
1. From your commentary last month: “The Great Entity is entirely unconscious of the Cosmos, in much the same way that you and I are unconscious of the deep processes of our own minds.”  This was such a lightning strike moment. I immediately consciously went at my subconscious processes – they were open and able to be moved like never before with that revelation in mind. No, we can’t get to the bottom of the deep processes of our minds, but by being made aware of their existence in that fashion I was able to so quickly go to work at changing some of them.  
2. Also from last month: “The Great Entity is therefore, in Fortune’s words, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe it has brought into being.”  I’m also going to connect this to commentary from October regarding the Trinity and the Three Rings. A nerdy passion of mine is seeing how universal truths manifest in different cultures and systems of knowledge.  Once you lift the veil on different descriptive words and names of deities across different cultures, you find that the holy people of any given culture did in fact have a firm grasp of creation and universal truths.  
2.a.  Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer in Hinduism as the triple deity, the Trimurti.  There’s a story about Brahma and Vishnu fighting over who was more powerful, when lo came a column of fire with no bottom nor top – Shiva the Destroyer, more powerful than both of them, here to prove it. It’s easy to see instinctively that this is a metaphorical tale about the Ring-Chaos and the Ring-Cosmos duking it out, but can’t quite fit everything into place at my current level of knowledge.
2.b. There is a dwarf planet in our solar system called Quaoar.  From the discoverer, Chad Trujillo, on his page at http://www.physics.nau.edu/~trujillo/quaoar/:
“The Tongva people (sometimes called the San Gabrielino Native Americans) inhabited the Los Angeles area before the arrival of the Spanish and other European people. The name “Quaoar” (pronounced kwah-o-wahr) comes from their creation mythology. In the words of Mark Acuña, Tongva scholar, dancer and tribal elder:
“‘Quaoar’ the great force of creation sings and dances the high ones (Deities) into existence. While Quaoar has no form or gender he is usually referred to with the male pronoun. He dances and sings first ‘Weywot’ who becomes Sky Father; they sing and dance ‘Chehooit’ Earth Mother into existence. The trio sing ‘Tamit’ Grandfather Sun to life. As each divine one joins the singing and dancing, the song becomes more complex and the dance more complicated…”
From NASA’s original press release in 2002 about the discovery, on the web at https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2002/02-190.txt:
“According to legend, Quaoar came down from heaven; and, after reducing chaos to order, laid out the world on the back of seven giants.”
This is fun! Looking forward to more.

I was kind of hoping that by this point, things would be getting a little bit easier to understand…but that doesn’t quite seem to be the case here!  Anyhow, a few reflections so far, mostly on this passage of text (if I have at all understood what Fortune is saying):
“You will perceive that the Logos, or subject, has become aware of an object; that object being a reflected projection, or replica, of the subject. Awareness of an external object on the part of the subject must be reproduced as a corresponding reflection of consciousness in the object, so that the object is equally capable of awareness of an external object. But the object, being of a different order of manifestation to the subject, cannot be aware of the subject but can only be aware of itself, and of the influences which proceed to it from the subject. Hence the saying that “No man hath at any time seen God”. God cannot be seen by any unit of the manifested universe during a manifestation. He can only be deduced.”
This section reminded me of the Kybalion, which also describes the universe as a mental creation in the mind of God (the All).  If this is indeed the case, then we and all created beings in our Solar System are held in the mind or consciousness of the Logos at the heart of our Solar System, which in turn is organized according to and held in the consciousness of a more evolved being, all the way back to the Unmanifest.  The Logos is trying to organize all the atoms (including us) according to the patterns of its consciousness, which it derived from journeying around the rings and rays – the framework of the Cosmos.  
This way of thinking about things flies in the face of dualism, which states that God is separate from the material creation of the world, God created it outside of himself, and in order to know God we must somehow transcend the material world. Or, I suppose, that God is somehow a product of matter and the material world. Instead it gives us monism or pantheism, in which God is immanent in every part of his creation, since everything is all mind through and through – even matter is a version of mind.  
Dion makes the point about pantheism somewhere in the last chapter, though, how it’s a half-truth, in that even though we are part of the mind of God, we are not identical with God.  We’re more like a thought that God is thinking in his mind.  A good analogy here would be like the characters in a book that are created by an author.  Even though the author is their creator, and the characters exist in the author’s mind, the characters are not identical with the author (I think that analogy may have been in the Kybalion). 
We can’t know God directly, for in order to know God, we would have to actually be the subject (God) – the one doing the thinking in the first place.  Of course that’s not possible – we are just the objects, the things being thought about.

Strangely enough, the night before I read this month’s chapter and JMG’s explication, I had a dream in which what I was told insists on overlaying its meaning on top of the chapter and I can’t unsee it. 
The reference point to the teaching was my daughter’s epilepsy when she was a child. The doctor at the time said that every time she had a seizure, the pathways in her brain that the electrical impulses travelled through were made deeper or bigger, like a highway, making it more likely that she would have more seizures. The medication she was given suppressed the electrical impulses to give time for her brain to overlay on top of these highways a new network. The highway did not disappear, but became overgrown with other pathways.
(Habits come to mind here.)
In any case, in the dream I was then told that we are tracks in a consciousness through which energy flows, like roads made by movements of energy through a mind. Energy flows through us, shaping us. We are not the neural network itself, we are the pathway. I’m not sure how else to explain this.
So I’m musing about this view of things, reading the chapter for this month, and thinking that if the solar system is the aura of the Solar Logos, it in turn is part of the aura of the central sun which must have gone through the same process our Great Entity went through, and is the consciousness that is behind everything in this cosmos. The divine sparks that we are, being movement acted on by the rays and circles, are simply tracks of this mind, if you will.
I don’t know if this deviates significantly from what Dion Fortune was saying, but that image is stuck in my head. I will have to meditate on this much more.

First, thanks to everyone for your stimulating comments. I really like the analogy by Wooler explaining the diffuseness of objective awareness. 
I think the interplay between thought and manifest reality discussed in this chapter is a really important concept: “…the evolution resembles a series of duplicating mirrors wherein the consciousness of the Logos projects its own image, becomes aware of and reacts to the image thus projected, and the reaction affects the projection, and so the cycle is everlastingly revolving.” 
Our thoughts create our Universe, our reality. How we react to this reality, whether consciously or by an unconscious knee-jerk reaction (a mental habit or track in space) ultimately snowballs over time to create joy or misery in our lives. We wonder why some people slowly become crotchety over time while others seem wise and magnanimous. The latter has realized that “thoughts are things” and consciously watch their minds to direct their lives towards a chosen end. The former crotchety ones simply are victims or pawns reacting to the tracks in space of their own created universe. We have many sayings, such as “do you see the glass as half full or half empty” to describe this process of mental creation through either a thoughtful or a knee-jerk reactive mind. 
There seems to be a level of conscious creation that is outside of our normal mental processes, however. This is from our subconscious that is affected by the greater Cosmic tides of the Rays and Rings, since “the sensations (of the tides on the subconscious) thus engendered in the Logoidal consciousness are forthwith incorporated in the self-projection, which is the universe, and the conscious consciousness of the Logos perceives them there.” This subconscious part of the mind seems to be like Jung’s collective unconscious, since all of humanity would be experiencing similar impulses from the greater Cosmic Rays and Rings at any given time, and thus, be expected to have similar unconscious impulses. Maybe the times when humanity seems to go crazy, such as the times of witch burning, are a result of a Cosmic impulse entering in through the collective subconscious (unconscious) of humanity at a point in time. I guess we can only partially consciously control the construction of the universe our minds create; the greater Cosmos is also an unseen participant (via our subconscious) in this creation process.

I was struck by several things when I did the reading.
1) For some reason, the description of atoms as being the “units of manifestation” being swept along by “currents and tides of Divine Power” clicked with me a lot more than the previous descriptions of the atoms. 
2) The idea of God having a subconscious was fairly startling to me. It seems to open up a lot of doors. Like others have said, this description of God seems far more relatable than the mainstream view.
3) So if the Solar Logos is going through the same process of evolution as the Cosmos, but in miniature, then it would seem to make sense that each planet in our system is going through the same process. I making a jump here, by adding in a layer of manifestation between the Solar Logos and we Divine Sparks. Rather than Solar Logos —-> Humans, I’m saying Solar Logos —-> Gaia —–> Humans, or Solar Logos —-> Jupiter —-> ???
In a way I got here by thinking of Jupiter’s moons. If Luna is an astrological influence here on Earth, then it stands to reason that Ganymede and Io and so on are influences on Jupiter. But Jupiter is its own microcosm, and I’m guessing we only get the gestalt effect of that whole microcosm. Same with Mars and Saturn and so on.
So my evolution as a human is a cycle within the greater evolution of Gaia, which is a cycle within the greater evolution of the Solar Logos. 
Alternatively, I have been inhaling too many PVC primer fumes.
4) The “series of duplicating mirrors,” and the systems theory mentioned a month or two ago, reminds me of the strange loops of “Godel, Escher, Bach.” I should probably spend some time meditating on this comparison, as I found Hofstadter’s book, and his smug materialism, extremely irritating.

David By Lake Michigan –
I have felt your pain. Just speaking from experience, it’s not wholly a matter of knowledge, you know. I don’t have any real serious scholastic aptitude (although I’m always happily learning this and that) and I’m not able to express spiritual concepts with any great clarity or with an eye to history and so forth. What I do have is a little bit of, what’s the word, let’s say “gnosis”. Even though I’m not able to connect all the particular dots in the Cos Doc, overall I get what DF is saying in the same way I get what J. Krishnamurti is saying and what Gurdjieff and Bubba Free John and Osho, and Jacob Boehme, etc., are saying, and I’m able to draw at least some telling spiritual distinctions between them. Again, this is not a matter of my non-existent towering intellect; it’s just a small touch of gnosis. When I read the Cos Doc, I have the feeling that in a sense, I’m learning what I already know, that DF, by expressing spiritual concepts in the way that she does, is helping me to really know what I already know. And there’s no end to it. For me, the Cos Doc is a bottomless well. 
An analogy: you walk into a recording studio and you see all the mixers and you think, how can anyone learn what all those levers and dials do? and your head begins to swim in despair. Of course the truth is you need only learn what a few of the levers do, then you see the pattern and it becomes obvious what all the levers do, at least on a basic intuitive level. 
Point is, study hard the thing before you and don’t let the rest of the levers distract you. Do that and I imagine that in time the patterns of all the levers will become obvious to you. Gnosis. 
And ease off now and then. Strain really bollixes up the brain. Let what you’ve learned come together on its own. To quote somebody, trust the process. 
Good fortune to you!

David, it’s become very common these days to assume that of course everything is nicely mapped, so we look at the map and figure out where we’re going and then go there. Imagine instead that it’s 1500 or so and beyond a certain point, the lines fade out and nobody knows what’s in those immense blank spaces. That’s where we are when we deal with the subject matter of occultism — and indeed, with much of human life. A verse of a song comes to mind: 
“East of O. van Kortlandt all the world was safe and known,
West of him the lines leapt off the map;
Luck or loss, the dice won’t speak ’til after they are thrown,
He packed his gear and stepped on board and dared Ginnungagap.
He would come back to Communipaw, but that just happened so,
He sailed from men to mystery, and did not travel slow,
He made them brace and bend their backs and row! Ho! Ho!” 
Ron, got it — you’re in the contest. I also find the later chapters more approachable than the earlier ones, for what it’s worth — all in all, not surprising, since the account Fortune offers has to start out at a very high level of abstraction and work down to more relatable things. 
Pogonip, tentacles are always welcome, and a tentacled horror from the Paleozoic is even more welcome! 😉
Wooler, you’re welcome and thank you! As they used to say back in the day, ’tis an ill wind that blows no minds.
Steve, good! We’ll be talking about those complex atoms in the chapters ahead, as they play a significant role in the metaphor. 
Athena, we’ll also be talking about the evolution of the Planetary Spirits in the chapters ahead. The metaphor’s got many layers of complexity still to go. Thank you for the material about Quaoar! 
Stefania, I don’t know, it sounds to me as though you’re doing a fine job of figuring it out. 
Myriam, first of all, since the point of the metaphor is to teach your mind to think in certain ways, not to hand over some specific set of beliefs to be accepted, it’s always appropriate to take the ideas Fortune is offering and try pushing them further. Second, I think Fortune would have approved heartily of your take on the Cosmos as the aura of the central Sun!
Dan, excellent! Yes, exactly. 
Cliff, yep. A few chapters from now we’ll be talking about the evolution of Planetary Spirits, so I wouldn’t worry about the primer fumes. As for Hofstadter’s book, I found it a fun read but, yeah, the smugness got a little much from time to time. It interests me that none of his later books had anything like the success of GEB.

Regarding crotchety people: I think some people see the glass as 7/8 empty and some see it as 1/8 full.  But the notion of guarding the mind and the imagination is well-taken.  For what it’s worth, a less well-known “fourth way” author named Rodney Collin wrote of “the long body of the sun” in one of his books that I read long ago.  There was even a drawing depicting it.  The sun traveling through space/time, with it and all its entourage of orbiting bodies leaving their permanent traces like a twisted rope.  The image is not unlike what is described in the current chapter.  I am one of those who are finding CosDoc a little more accessible as we get down to the human scale.

Wooler, the “archduid was ironic gag, no way someone so lucid in writing is heavy into occult” was close to my first impression too. How the mind change. 
As for metaphor to get a sense of proportion about our ability to comprehend the other planes, I like to think about it this way:  there are more than 40000 spiders spices known; we don’t know everything about them, we have no way to know if we even counted them all, since every year a new species are added, their most distinctive feature – web building – is current open question, not fully explained. One person can send lifetime of study just to get to being relative expert on spiders alone. We don’t know spiders – how can we know spirits? 
And spiders are not even all arachnids, scorpions are distinctive family tree. 
We don’t know how the collective mind of anthill works – and we are going to figure out how a god’s mind work?

Hi John Michael,
I just wanted to clarify with you a thought that popped into my mind whilst reading your essay. I assume that as a Divine Spark reincarnates over several lifespans, the Tracks in Space, get ever more complex and perhaps far ranging, and that free will is sort of like the ‘wild card’ that can lead – not too far from the Tracks in Space mind you – but to different destinations and possibilities? Dunno.
Speaking of dreams, I had a whopper two nights ago. It was a nightmare actually, and I dreamed that a very large chunk of ice slipped off then land and fell into the ocean – although the ice was represented as a very large snowball in the dream and I was watching it from the perspective of the ocean and felt that I was about to get sucked down into the depths. I woke up in a sweat and in a panic, that’s for sure.
It is funny that I can have such vivid dreams, but I have no facility at all with a visualising images in my head.
I’m enjoying this series of posts, but they remind me of my first year at Uni. The first few classes were packed with people, and then slowly as the semester progressed (!), the lectures became ever more empty. Students these days might miss that observation, because I have heard that many lectures nowadays are streamed over the interweb. Whatever will ‘they’ think of next? 🙂
Cheers

JMG and all – (admission – I posted this on Day 6 of the February Cos Doc commentary, too late, I think for any comments, so here it is again. I hope my re-commenting is okay, but if not, no problem with me if it’s deleted. Thank you – wm).
I’m finding it very interesting in comparing Dion Fortune’s Cosmic Doctrine with the work of Jacob Boehme, the early 17th c Christian mystic and theologian. Both have Kabbalist influences (though it’s somewhat in doubt if Boehme actually ever saw a copy of the Kabbalah), both had Christian perspectives, albeit very unorthodox ones, both outlined a schematic of the evolution of the Cosmos, both stress the so-above/so-below fractal nature of the Cosmos, both employ metaphors, obviously, to get their message across, both seem to contradict themselves at times, the usual trip-wire for the overly materialist mind, both are dense, often seemingly impenetrable, requiring long periods of meditation – and both seem bottomless in their insights; return to them again and again and you’ll find a new revelation or meaning to be had. 
Boehme of course, doesn’t use modern science tropes as does DF, and he’s nowhere as elaborate in his depiction of the cycles-within-cycles nature of the Cosmos, but here’s one interesting similarity – they both describe the Cosmos as beginning with *movement*. In DF’s “scientific” description, the prime movement is of a current in space that due to the pressures of momentum and inertia, curve around to eventually form the Cosmos-enclosing Rings. Now, this is obviously a metaphor because before Manifestation there was no “space” or time, for that matter, through which a current could move. Boehme, on the other hand, seems more direct in describing the movement as somehow taking place within the endless Unity of the Unmanifest. It unravels like this – an “unequal pressure” in the Divine equilibrium came about because of desirousness “to be something”. The desire became concentrated because the Unmanifest Unity “had nothing of which it may make something to itself”, and so the Unity compressed itself into a yearning, a “magnetical hunger”.
Unequal pressure leads to a flowing, a motion (basic physics). Thus an agitation, an “anguish” results, this due to the insatiability of the Divine desire. The anguish however, is the original source of sensibility and the capacity for feeling – out of nothingness, a somethingness has been born. Divine nature becomes perceptible to itself, and it is out of this fiery matrix that the Cosmos is formed. The Unmanifest becomes the Manifest, but it is a sublimated Manifest – because the Divine Unity is now mirrored in the mode of perceptivity, it can manifest in infinite myriad forms.
So, just as The Cosmic Doctrine outlines the macro-microcosm scheme of the Cosmos – from Rings to Solar Logos to humans – so Boehme has his own above/below scheme, in which the original desire-to-anguish-to-manifestation/Enlightenment of the Unmanifest is reflected in our own spiritual lives. That is, through our acceptance of necessary pain and anguish, we grow in spiritual perceptivity, and we literally participate in the nothingness-to-somethingness that is the essence of Divine Creation. And that’s why it’s an error to think of our “lower self” as something to be discarded or eradicated – our lower self is rather the ground base, the necessary spark that inspires the manifestation of divine love and enlightenment.
Of course, with his emphasis on surrender, Boehme stands as a mystic. Dion Fortune is a mage, and I suppose that is the critical difference between them. Still, between them, there seems to be plenty of overlapping themes and parallels.

One of the things that occurred to me in this chapter was the memory of my niece as a baby, looking into a mirror my brother had mounted on the wall low to the floor. She would look at herself, figuring out who this baby was, who moved when she did. As she hit the terrible twos, she would fling herself onto the floor and kick and scream, and check herself in the mirror, and look to see her parents’ reaction. She was very much the center of her universe, the subject, recognizing objects around her, and only slowly figuring out that we, her family, were not just objects, but subjects in our own right.
Thanks for the guidance in reading this- I likely would have finished it quickly, given myself credit for having read it, but not understood it nearly as well as I am with your (and the commentariat’s) help.

Hi JMG
I was recently reading a translation of the Corpus Hermeticum and it reminded me of the Cosmic Doctrine.   Is that a coincidence?  I expect it’s reasonable to think that Fotune would have incorporated some of that imagery in her knowledge base when she was contemplating this.  Would it be beneficial for those of us who are struggling with the Cosmic Doctrine to read the Corpus Hermeticum or something similar along with it?  If so do you have a recommendation of a recent translation?  I know you wrote an introduction to one but in that introduction you mentioned the style was rather dated.
Thank you for continuing this study!

Kay, excellent. Yes, there are — it’s sometimes useful to simplify things with a broad division into two or three or four, but it’s worth remembering that this is a convenience for the sake of thinking and that reality is far more complex. 
Phutatorius, I remember that illustration! 
Chris, exactly. The tracks in space we build with our repetitive thoughts in one life become the paths in which we move in another, and eventually are incorporated into who we are. As for the dwindling class size, yes, and I expected that. One way or another I’m going to finish the sequence. 
Will J, enjoy the meditations! 
Will M, the connections and similarities aren’t accidental. “The kabbalah” isn’t a single book but a very broad tradition, and there was a lot of Cabalistic material in Latin and German by the time Boehme lived — given that he studied the writings of Paracelsus and a flurry of Christian mystics, it would have been very difficult for him to miss picking up Cabalistic material. Then of course there’s the fact that Boehme had a huge following after his death in England, and his writings massively influenced English esoteric and occult circles, including those that gave rise to the traditions in which Fortune had her training. Given her intense interest in Protestant Christian mysticism, I’d be amazed if she hadn’t read at least a little Boehme, or perhaps the development of Boehme’s thought by Jane Leade and William Law. 
That is to say, you’re on to something. 😉
Sidney, glad to hear it. 
Katsmama, it’s a slow process for humans, and probably a slower process for solar logoi, but yeah, that’s a fine example. 
Pogonip, don’t worry about it. Just take each image one at a time, without trying to make sense of the whole pattern, and explore the thoughts related to that image. That’ll train the mind just as effectively. 
Candace, Fortune will have studied the Corpus Hermeticum pretty intensively as part of her Golden Dawn training. I don’t know that it’s necessary but you might find it useful. The Brian Copenhaver translation is the best that I know of that’s currently available.

I’m still here too, also a bit behind and over my head, but appreciating the discussion. It’s good to have the reminder that I don’t need to make sense of the whole pattern at once. I know that was the first thing DF told us, but the lifelong training to try and “figure the whole thing out” rather than just experience it piece by piece is so hard to forget. But the images others have offered here- that I’m not going to drink the whole lake or know all about all the spiders- are helpful. Now back to the text…

Re partially-filled glasses
I can understand the imagery but in some sense, a 1/8th-full glass is a failure of 87.5%; even at 7/8ths-full, you’re talking 12.5% performance failure.  At the end of the day, have we maximized our potential or have we failed to do that?
@ JMG
The more I read in Cos Doc (and this material generally), the more I get the sense that what we’re working with plane-wise is a thin sliver of a vast spectrum.  I think you may have alluded to this analogy before, but thinking here of visible light versus the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with infinite ranges above and below.  Simultaneously frightening, exhilarating, and frustrating 🙂

Despite what Chris says  *waves at Chris*  I comment less on these Cosdoc threads, but have not left them.  In fact I read the post more times, and spend time studying the comments, but also feel less competent to have something useful to say.  
So, I want to say, by all means, please continue, even though some of us have not left so much as we are left gobsmacked. 
In any case there are several things in this post that have me thinking.  The addition of “play” to the process of growing and learning that everything in the Cosmos is going through, strikes me as an excellent word.  In play there is exploration, there is discovery, there are rules set out within a defined area, there is experimentation, but there is no fixed outcome. In play, there can be novelty.  Indeed, in today’s corporate-patron model of science, scientist’s complain most keenly that the element of play has been removed from their job descriptions. 
Religions might also rightly complain that the element of play has long been missing. My own father, a Christian missionary, has written a book on elements of play in God’s creation, and the way the sabbath was supposed to stress the importance of “re-creation” to the created.   
And, although it is not a coincidence that theatre spectacle may also be called “a play” – it seems to me that the kind of play that children, and adults who are freed from the expectation of producing a set result, naturally do, is realler and freer than the kind of thing referred to in “all the world’s a stage” which seems about fakery, and trickery, to me.  That is to say, if I consider that whatever I encounter is something playing, it may feel good or bad, but I can relate to what’s happening as profound, and a part of something’s learning process.  Whereas if I thought I was living a play that was staged by somebody, I’d feel somehow lessened, as if I was a character, mouthing the script they wrote.  Anyway, that the Cosmos, the Logos, Divine Sparks and all down to myself, and further down to the bacterial realm, and further down again to the atomic realm, and as far as tracks in space can go, are all playing, and learning, and growing, in the context of one anothers playings (whether conscious or not), seems right to me.
There are some other things about “tracks in space” and how they are the basis for spirit and matter and consciousness that I am thinking about from a clinical point of view.  Thanks for giving me the material/metaphor to think with.

At this point in our journey, it seems to me that DF, in building a metaphorical narrative that translates motion into mind, is in some ways inverting, but in other ways mimicking, the origin narratives of naive materialism. The inversion is in the dimension of scale. Fortune starts with universal motion on a cosmic scale and eventually, through many intermediate patterns and entities on a progressively decreasing scale of time and distance, works her way to mind and eventually to the human mind of our own experience. While of course the materialism of her day started with the motions of particles and built up in scale to molecules to organs to mind (unfortunately stopping at human intelligence, which is one of two main reasons I call it naive).
The mimicking is in the (so far) rather mechanistic description of the process. Fortune writes (so far) of attractions and forces and influences rather than, for instance, preferences, choices, volitional actions, plans, or goals. That’s a surprise to me, certainly not my expectation going in. 
Now that the narrative has introduced consciousness, in a way that applies at all scales, it’s looking like the complete picture does include a sentient Cosmic Mind (even if on a scale that’s beyond our perception or reasonable concern). That part’s not a surprise, but in Fortune’s metaphor even such an entity is situated. This strikes me as a much sturdier conceptual construct than starting with a Cosmic Mind as an axiom, then explaining everything else as the design or preferences or whims of that entity. Instead, from any given viewpoint there is a ONE, but on any scale, even the ONE always has, let’s see, flow, limits, balance, rhythm, evolution…
Big whorls have little whorls
That feed on their velocity
And little whorls have lesser whorls
And so on to viscosity. – Lewis Fry Richardson
(That verse dates back to 1922, but was little-known for many years, so DF may or may not have seen it at the time of writing The Cosmic Doctrine.)
I suspect it’s a false dilemma to ask whether, outside of metaphor, existence “really” develops downward from the cosmic, or upward from the quantum. Like looking at a Mandelbrot zoom and asking whether the bigger swirls spawn the smaller ones within them, or the bigger ones emerge from the smaller. Neither is really true; they’re all generated by one algorithm. A useful understanding may require picking one or the other model and running with it. But, just maybe, it doesn’t.

I do confess though to getting off rhythm when we had the bye month in January. The February post snuck up on me. I was late to class and not prepared, and March was a complete miss because I was busy for two weeks doing my civic duty as a citizen, listening to testimony and deciding with 11 other people the fate of the accused based on the presence or absence of reasonable doubt. (And that was quite an intense experience that left little room for much else.)
I’m caught up now and have no plans to drop this class. I continue to find the Cosmic Doctrine fascinating, thought-provoking, and mind-expanding, not to mention in some sense heart-opening.
What I discover frequently is that reading and thinking about the concepts Fortune presents cause me to hark back to my Buddhist studies for a bit of compare and contrast. I am much less schooled in any Western or Christian religions than I am in Buddhism, though it’s been a while. My thoughts went once again to the concept of dependent origination. This-that, me-you, inner-outer, subject-object, both arising simultaneously because mutually dependent, reinforcing, causing, even creating each other. I also harked back for some reason to the concept of the five skandhas (form, feeling, perception, mental formation [impulses], consciousness), and I continue to think about how that might relate to concepts in the CosDoc. Echoes and reverberations in the mind as new concepts and images are introduced like pebbles dropping into a lake, creating new patterns in the surface of the water as patterns flow and combine in new ways into the deeper currents below. Interesting that you mention Jung in this week’s explication, one of my teachers long ago remarked that Jung created conditions so that Buddhism could be understood in the West. 
Thanks for all the meditations,
Yanocoches

Hi John Michael,
Thanks for the reply. You always give us a lot to consider. It has been my experience that numbers are not generally commensurate with quality – and this is certainly the case here, and I never for one moment doubted that you had the gumption to finish this excellent series of posts! Isn’t your writing here on the subject the opposite of the concept of ‘to occlude’ what is an important topic?
Hi Will,
Thanks for the shout out! Mate, it never occurred to me that someone could see the decline in numbers on those lecture videos. My experience was all at lectures IRL. 😉 I have noticed that the debt does not disappear with the lack of attendance!
Hi Scotlyn,
Thanks for the shout out! I like the concept of play as it applies to this topic too. Interesting!
Cheers
Chris

Divine Sparks of light, swirling tracks, spirit, memory, … reminds me of the game I started up recently… Everybody’s Gone To The Rapture by Chinese Room… I haven’t finished it yet, but, I’ll have to start over with the perspective from this post now.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Evolution of Consciousness 
May 8, 2019May 10, 2019John Michael Greer71 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 11, “The Evolution of Consciousness,” pp. 52-54.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 12, “The Birth of Consciousness in the Universe,” pp. 73-76.
Commentary:
This is a difficult chapter for many students, but it’s also a very important one, for in it Fortune develops her set of metaphors for consciousness in directions that will have important practical implications. We’ll take it a little at a time.
It’s important, to begin with, to remember the definition of consciousness Fortune introduced in the previous chapter: “consciousness is reaction plus memory.” Think about that for a moment. If you had reactions but no memory, the sensations of each instant would erase the sensations of the previous instant. What’s more, none of the sensations would mean anything to you, because meaning is what occurs when you connect a present reaction to a memory from the past: when we say the letter A means a particular sound used in speech, or the word “cat” refers to a four-legged creature that meows, what that indicates is that you connect the shape of the letter or the word to the memory of a sound or an animal.
Alternatively, if you had memory but no reaction, your awareness would be fixed on whatever happened to be in your memory, if anything was, and you would be completely oblivious to what was happening to you at the moment. Combine reaction and memory, though, and you have consciousness; you can perceive at least a little of what is going on around you, and what you perceive can be linked to past perceptions so that it means something to you.
That’s one of two definitions of consciousness that Fortune provides. The other is included again in the present chapter:  “consciousness is an integration of reactions, so that any change in any part is responded to by the corresponding adjustments of the whole.” This definition approaches the same subject from a different angle. Those corresponding adjustments of the whole are the basis of memory; something happens, and the whole system becomes a little different. It is affected by the change: that’s reaction. Its structure is changed in an enduring way by the thing that has happened: that’s memory.
Human consciousness is this same process made complex by billions of years of evolution, but the same patterns can be seen at work in the brain. Sensory organs respond to specific ranges of stimuli: that’s reaction. The brain responds by laying down complex electrobiochemical patterns that enable the reaction to be recalled at a later date: that’s memory. Combine the two and you’ve got the material basis for consciousness. These same two processes can be seen at work in many things other than human beings, some of them not even defined as living by our current notions of what life is. Does that suggest that these things are also conscious, each in its own way? Why, yes, that is indeed what it suggests.
Fortune goes on to differentiate between two levels of consciousness, one of them in the background, the other in the foreground. Each conscious being, whether we’re discussing a Solar Logos or one of the countless beings who inhabit the solar system the Logos has created, has some capacities for reaction that have already been worked out in all their permutations over past cycles of experience, and other capacities for reaction that have just been developed by contact with new experiences and have not yet settled into stable relationships. In the case of the Solar Logos, the first of these categories—the background of capacities for reaction that have settled into stable patterns—are the results of its experiences as a traveling atom journeying out and back along the twelve Rays. The second of these categories—the new capacities for reaction still needing to be integrated into a balanced whole—are the results of its experiences as it reflects on itself, and notices its own reactions to the great Cosmic tides.
Human beings, like all other beings in the solar system, also have these two levels of consciousness or, to put things another way, these two parts of the self. The background of capacities for reaction gained in previous lives is called the Individuality, or the Higher Self; the foreground of new capacities being sorted out by conscious action in this life is called the Personality, or the Lower Self. These can be called, without too much inaccuracy, the unconscious and the conscious selves.
It’s important to understand how these two parts of the self relate. The Personality in each life lays down reaction-capacities that become part of the Individuality in future lives.  In each new life, in turn, the Personality unfolds from the reactions of the Individuality to new experiences. We don’t experience the Individuality directly, because our attention is fixed by the foreground of new reactions to new experiences. but it forms the enduring background to the mental activities we perceive.
It would not be going too far, in fact, to speak of the Individuality by using that old-fashioned term “character.” Your Individuality is the basis of your character, the source of those enduring habits of thought and action that frame the way you relate to the world. Your Personality can be thought of as a set of potential additions to your Individuality, which you are trying out in the changing conditions of your present life. “That which is the Personality today will be part of the Individuality to-morrow,” Fortune writes; readers who know their way around the literature of Freudian psychology, which Fortune studied extensively at one point in her career, will recognize this as a wry commentary on Freud’s overconfident dictum “where Id was, there shall Ego be.”
The Solar Logos or Great Entity goes through the same process on a much vaster timescale. Its Personality comes into being as it contemplates the effects of the changing Cosmic tides on itself, and this Personality is built up along the lines already laid down by the Great Entity’s experience of the Cosmos. So, in this Personality, there are currents of motion that arc around after vast ages to become three vast Rings; there are twelve Rays that stream out from a center and return to it; there are atoms born of tangential movements set in motion by the Rays, which are caught up and swept along in the currents of motion. All told, there is a mirror image of the Cosmos, reflected in the consciousness of the Great Entity, and this becomes a universe of its own—but the Solar Logos is not the only inhabitant of that universe.
There are also the Cosmic atoms that were swept up by the Great Entity on its way out to its orbit on the seventh Cosmic plane. They sort themselves out into orbits surrounding the Great Entity according to their own Cosmic plane of origin. As the Great Entity evolves a Personality—or, to put the same point in a different way, as the Great Entity brings its solar system into being, for the Great Entity’s Personality and its solar system are one and the same thing—the other Cosmic atoms are caught up again in the patterns of movement laid down by the Great Entity in its dance. They become the Divine Sparks of the beings who will inhabit the solar system, and in over the vast cycles of the solar system’s evolution they evolve too, developing their own capacities for reaction and memory.
In the period we are discussing, the period of the first stirrings of consciousness, all this is far in the future. The first development of consciousness in the newborn solar system does not take place in individual Divine Sparks, although it affects them. Instead, the patterns of movement in space laid down by the Solar Logos in his contemplation become organized among themselves, forming a whole system in which a change to any part affects all the other parts. Consciousness is born, in the form of a vast Oversoul that links everything in the solar system. Eventually individual souls will emerge from that Oversoul, but the time for that has not yet arrived.
Two points deserve to be noticed here. First, since the solar system is projected as a thought-form by the Great Entity, it and everything in it contain all the reaction-capacities of the Great Entity in latent form. The Divine Sparks and the embodiments they create around themselves go through the same stages of evolution as the traveling atom that became the Great Entity, but they do so much more quickly, because they are recapitulating rather than breaking new ground. “And God made man after His image, according to His likeness,” says the Book of Genesis; The Cosmic Doctrine agrees entirely with this statement, but interprets it in a way that draws an unexpected kind of sense out of it.
Second, in the relationship between pure movement in space and the stable atoms generated by movement we have the first sketch of the relation of soul to body. Fortune asks the reader to imagine that each atom, as it moves through space, leaves an invisible “track” of pure movement which remains behind it, frictionless and therefore persistent. If a second atom gets drawn into the same “track” as the first, the “track” deepens and strengthens, while at the same time the track is changed at least a little by the vagaries of the atom. Repeat this countless times, and the track in space becomes a rut along which atom after atom moves.
This is the way the Oversoul affects the individual atoms it overshadows. As the atoms develop new capacities for movement from their encounters with the Oversoul, they lay down their own internal patterns of tracks in space, simple at first and then mounting to dizzying levels of complexity.  In this way the atom begins to develop its own mental dimension, and from the Oversoul emerges an individual soul capable of passing through the cycles of evolution itself.
Notes for Study:             
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on June 12.  Until then, have at it!

Would there be any value in accessing the Individuality more directly?  (Perhaps it is a moot point, in any event.)  My first thought in reading the description was the Bene Gesserit of the Dune universe and their shared-lives (although these were not exclusively their own previous incarnations and were embodied more concretely within the psyche).
Generally, I think of accreted layers, rather like geological strata, of Personalities which form that Individuality, while the current Personality is the surface/top-most layer which can interact directly with the external world.  That imagery does make a good deal of sense. 
But the first definition of consciousness did make me look to the broader concepts we’ve discussed on this blog about things we stereotypically think of as inert (a stone, a river, a planet, a star) as being conscious.  And I’ll admit that the underlining of that notion here does cause my eyes to open rather wide…

Yes, this was a difficult chapter, but it was short at least.  I’m relatively certain that Sheldrake’s name will come up in relation to those ruts in space that DF discusses.  I think Sheldrake was preceded in the notion of a “chreod” by the developmental biologist C. H. Waddington.  The wikipedia article is useful here – and suggestive relative to DF’s thesis – but that’s about all I have to say about Waddington at this point.  
I have a question about the cover on the hardback Helios edition.  The cover depicts a solar system in which all the planets resemble eyes.  Surely that was deliberate on the part of the artist.  Who was the artist?  Any idea?.

David BTL, Jung’s concept of the unconscious is a little like what you’re suggesting: you have the personal unconscious, then the familial unconscious, then the ethnic unconscious, and so on back to layers that were laid down before our ancestors descended from the trees. A great deal would depend on whether the different layers serve different functions or act in different ways. 
Phutatorius, yes, I was thinking of Sheldrake, and also of Waddington — the concept of the chreod was discussed at some length in the systems theory class I took in my first pass through college. As for the dust jacket, I have no idea — you’d probably have to contact Gareth Knight, who ran Helios Book Service back in the day, and ask him.

Goodness me.
‘Chreod’, ‘Waddington’
I quote Gare, 2017,  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28843479
“Waddington explained the development of the concept of chreod as the influence on his work of Alfred North Whitehead’s process philosophy, notably, the concept of concrescence as a self-causing process. Processes were recognized as having their own dynamics, rather than being explicable through their components or external agents.”
I cannot go down that road nor into the remarkable mathematics that resulted after Waddington. I will continue to wander among the semantics and metaphors. I have a wistful thought to write something definitive: perhaps’The Discovery of Instinct’, and to meditate on the examples beyond mundane explanation that have riveted my attention when I was lucky enough to experience or see them – human and otherwise.

This provoked quite an experiment.  I had the same thoughts as David BTL re: tremendous possibilities of consciousness.  It is my experience that crystals are alive and conscious and willing to communicate, but until this post, I did not have a framework to explain why or how.  As always, thank you for the most excellent teachings.
Mountains are most definitely alive and conscious, made so via this same process, and so packed with Herculean energy that they might blow you sideways just a bit the first time you try to communicate with them as conscious entities and fellow travellers in the extant spacetime around you. 
Since by deduction it might be presumed canyons are also alive and conscious, I decided to experiment a bit.  I attempted to reach out to the Grand Canyon in the U.S. and got a very Saturnian, gruff old man style response.  He does not want to communicate, and quite possibly just doesn’t like humans.  It might be the pollution inflicted on his air by humans, but he wouldn’t tell me.  I was never really told to stuff it and go away, just the energetic equivalent of annoyed grunts and scoffs to anything I did.  I tried again, with the Gorges du Verdon in France, and got a response that indicates pure peace.  Every response indicated it wanted me to slow down and slide into peace.  The energy was similar to that which I pick up from larimar – from one online resource: “Larimar is a crystal of serenity, promoting relaxation in every aspect.”  That’s what attempting to communicate with the Gorges du Verdon did – promote relaxation, actively so, with every response.  Like “come join me and relax.  Just relax.”  Finally, I reached out to a canyon I’ve been to, the one you can see when you’re standing in front of the Prince of Wales hotel at Waterton Lakes National Park.  This canyon wanted me to climb mountains and have a look around; go for adventure.  It actively promotes reaching for greater heights and seeing sights unseeable until you’re at the pinnacle.  
So, that’s three canyons, two of which persistently tried to get me to take a particular action in response to my contacting them, and one of which made guttural noises in my general direction but didn’t try to convince me of anything.  
How much of this is the entity of the canyon itself responding to my reaching out, and how much of it is the nature spirits overseeing the energy in their locality, or however one might describe the relationships involved, is a question I hope to answer by keeping up with this reading.   
Speaking of keeping up with this reading, I came up with a tip for those who feel this is incomprehensible.  I was able to make far, far quicker sense of it this month by reading aloud and by putting a lot of emotion into it.  If anyone out there is lost… just give it a try, read the text out loud, using the intonations you would if you were the teacher and were trying to explain it to someone else.







 David, by the lake says: 



								May 8, 2019 at 6:35 pm							




John—
Is there a distinction in the Individuality as layered Personalities between the physical/biological (e.g. hardwiring of the brain, evolutionary accretions) and the psycho-spiritual (e.g. past lives which may or may not hav been in any particular family tree)?  Is the former operation one one plane (the physical) and the latter on another (astral)?







 Will J says: 



								May 8, 2019 at 7:09 pm							




Tying this into Druid philosophy, does it make sense to speak of the transition to Gwynfudd as the point where a soul develops the capacity to be conscious of the background and foreground of consciousness at the same time?







 Will J says: 



								May 8, 2019 at 7:14 pm							




David,
Extending the geology metaphor, the older selves would gradually be transformed by time and pressure, and occasionally there would be things like volcanoes bringing older material to the surface. The result is that for all but the uppermost layers things have been mashed and churned so much that there’s no resemblance to the initial forms, and even on the surface, the events that happen deep beneath have relevance, since sometimes they’ll come bursting forth, and other times they’ll just shift things (like an earthquake), sometimes a little, sometimes a great deal.
I like this metaphor a great deal.

For some reason this makes complete sense to me. Perhaps I need to read the chapter more and get confused, but so much of this seems to click. However that is after hours on the road thinking about it, my form of carbon-fueled meditation. Consciousness seems to be plastic, representing past conditions and future experiences. 
I am wondering about the relationship between this and an earlier commentary on the Cos.Doc about how every action and reaction generates in itself a mini-form of the great rings. For example, a thought, a relationship, a word, has its own permeable ring cosmos, ring chaos, and ring pass-not. These mini-rings probably reflect the great rings, through the mediating influence of the oversoul from the great entity. That led me to wonder about the boundary between the solar system and the rest – in the physical plane we would experience that as the heliosheath, which as we know is permeable. Things from inside pass outside it (Voyager 1 for instance), and things from outside (cosmic rays) pass through it too, but it does represent a barrier of sorts. 
I would also ask – does the astral light come from the Great Entity/Oversoul, and is it present on all planes?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								May 8, 2019 at 10:49 pm							




Phil, thanks for this! I didn’t happen to know that Waddington was riffing off Whitehead — all I knew about him was what was covered in that long-ago systems theory class. 
Athena, nicely done. You’re right, too, that reading the text aloud is one way to make sense of it — we process words differently when we hear them than when we read them, and doing both at once gives the brain two chances to grasp the meaning. 
David BTL, the first is etheric as well as physical, but yes. broadly speaking. 
Will, that’s the point when you begin to be able to do that. 
Peter, good. Those strike me as good themes for meditation. As for the astral light, as the name suggests, it’s on the astral plane; we’ll get to the genesis of the different planes of being as this proceeds.

This chapter really set my head spinning (which has already been spinning with movements and rings turning, and rays and circles and traveling atoms…). It has set me to thinking about reincarnation and our overall Individuality, as it has been termed here. And looking at the development of consciousness and the Individuality/Personality of our Solar Logos, and if it can reincarnate, just on a different scale than we reincarnate.  And then I wonder if that would be possible, could our solar logos be in an incarnation that is not its first. I still haven’t meditated enough even to understand what being a traveling atom means for our logos. I also am thinking that people often think about being ‘one with the cosmos’, but that we are much closer to being part of the oversoul of the solar system, and so what does that mean for us? I have but a dim understanding so far of what I am reading in the chapter, but I have lots of themes for meditation over the next month (and I’m beginning to think, the rest of my lifetime).

Hi, JMG. So if magic is “a change in consciousness according to will” and “consciousness is reaction plus memory”, is it the reaction or the memory that distinguishes magic from other forms of intervention? Or is there a special definition for “will” that will ;-/ be helpful in resolving the riddle?

Our culture cannot seem to accept the “spirits in the material world” theory of evolution as laid out in the Cosmic Doctrine.  Freud did not acknowledge the force animating a newborn baby as having gotten there first.  From what I can tell, modern humans across the spectrum of religiosity have the idea that we humans are meat-bots who must grow up in order to experience the realms of anything higher than physical sensation.  These realms are outside and separate to us according to modern concept.  When a human embryo becomes viable, the atheist thinks it is a piece of meat with the potential to become smarter for no apparent reason.  The Christian thinks the embryo’s development is independent of the mother or the incarnating soul; it’s a single-use decision made by a remote and often cruel being who lives in the sky.   Either way, we have a meat-bot who can only make itself worthy by chasing after attainments outside and above itself in a single lifetime.  I perceive the Cosmic Doctrine to be saying, “No, you’ve got it all wrong/backwards, soul first, flesh later, and more lives than your tiny brain can understand”.
I was an agnostic leaning strongly towards atheism until I ran into JMG’s essay on reincarnation. I was the piece of meat who developed a bit of a mind; just enough that I felt a cheerful nihilism about my own death.  I genuinely thought it was the first and last time I would live and then boing, I’d be off to permanent oblivion.  So why I had any urge to be decent and not to spend the rest of my life hurting my enemy’s feelings and snorting cocaine off the chests of handsome cabana boys was a mystery.  I’ve now had odd experiences of remembering (in bits and pieces) fragments from past lives.  I’ve learned enough to know I was a comedian/court jester guy who traveled and sang and played a stringed instrument.  His karma has led to the situations I am living down right now.  It’s the training he received from his father that gave me much of the musical talent and ability and patience to instruct others I use to make a living.  His karma was not all good by any means, of course.  He’s not the only one I remember, however, he’s the one I’m clearest about what happened in his life.  I also dread admitting this for fear everyone will assume I’m nuts, but I’m pretty sure I remember being a cat.  Life isn’t easy if you’re a cat, unless you are my cat.  At any rate, it’s my own remembrances of reincarnation that help me with this chapter, though most of it remains over my head.

Just meditated a bit while travelling by train.
With those cycles evolution gets a direction that is guided by consciousness.
Thus evolution is not pure trial and error as conventionally taught but more a guided process, which make much sense for me.

Oh, one further thing, I can see all of this leading to a comprehensive description of the ecology of the cosmos as well as of the self. About how we as humans are a system of systems, sitting within an unimaginably large system, all with limits, homeostatic processes, and energetic flow.

Since the comments have dropped off last essay and this one, I wanted to pop in to let it be known that I’m still following closely, I just didn’t happen to have anything meaningful to contribute last time or this one. That, and it’s just starting to make more sense as we proceed. I’m sure at least part of the lull in comments is that others have also been reading without writing in for whatever reason.
Please keep up the good work! I would absolutely not be able to parse the Cos Doc to the degree I have without these essays. I have gotten to the point that I just read the essay first, then the chapter, and it saves me a lot of trouble.

Hi John, I’m writing as a followup to the question I posted yesterday regarding the connection between Fortune’s definition of magic and her definition of consciousness.  I DO think my question was very much pertinent to The Cosmic Doctrine, but – since you haven’t addressed it, nor ignored it, yet – I thought I would write a followup.  Obviously, I am very, very interested in the definition of magic.  That is because I have either been working large-scale magic in the world for several decades … or I have not. Until I began reading you, I didn’t concern myself too much about how the various “miracles” were happening. I knew I was consciously using positive thinking and trance states; the outcomes FELT like magic; I didn’t see the point in dwelling too much on distinctions as long as I was getting results.
Anyway, since you persist on not directly answering my question for a clarification (extension) of the definition, but keep tossing it back at me to meditate on some more;-?, I thought your dwelling on the definition of “consciousness” this week was a good lead.
I am GUESSING the “consciousness” which must ALWAYS be changed by “will”, is the cosmic consciousness.  I am guessing the “will” is that of any sentient being within the cosmos.  So the all is made aware (my word) and then remembers some “change” in its totality…which becomes the new reality.
That would all seem to fit the constraints of the definition of magic, I think. However it doesn’t really address core concern: why are some things NOT magic?  Specifically, if I willfully remove someone’s lifelong, intense phobia … that changes THEIR consciousness and that changes the world, as well.  Why is that not magic?  W/hat of Clarke’s Law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”?   Even ritual magic has “technique”, right?
Anyway, I continue to think the world (universe) could benefit from a little more clarity in the definition of magic in order to be more open to magic. A square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not necessarily a square.

“You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?” Andy asked.  
“No,” Red replied.
“They say it has no memory.  That’s where I want to live the rest of my life.  A warm place with no memory.”
I tried to talk to the Pacific Ocean once, this time when I was standing right next to it.  I got a warbly response like billions of voices flitting around, but no cohesion.  It was Neptunian in the extreme, and I understood oceanic energy – and Neptune – better by the attempt.  
This post, then, explains why.  If the Pacific Ocean has no memory, it cannot develop a consciousness.  It has reactions, but no memories.
This doesn’t mean there aren’t parts of the ocean that are conscious.  The harbors have memories.  The coves have keen memories, carved as they were by time and pressure.
The ocean currents are not, themselves, conscious. Rather, they’re tracks the atoms follow on the physical plane.  The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a Central Stillness of that particular set of Rings that would, unchecked, probably burst forth into creating its own new entity.  Maybe it already has; it’s certainly been strengthened in entity-hood a lot by the attention to it.

Cat, excellent! Fortune’s metaphor doesn’t deal with the possibility that a Solar Logos might  create one solar system, take it through its entire life cycle, contemplate the results of the experience, and then do it again — that would be what reincarnation would look like on that scale. On the other hand, other books of occult philosophy portray things in exactly this way, and Fortune may have meant her students to make that leap themselves. One way or another, though, you’re right that the themes in this modestly sized book can keep you productively meditating for a long, long time. 
Gnat, wrangling over definitions has long struck me as one of the least productive of all human activities, and these days it pretty much always has an unhelpful agenda of some kind, I’ll discuss this further in response to your later and lengthier comment below. 
Kimberly, fascinating. I’m glad that essay of mine was useful to you! Fortune points out in one of her other books — at the moment I’ve forgotten which one — that an understanding of reincarnation is one of the great gifts that occult study has to offer; once you get past the “meat-bot” illusion and grasp the point that matter arises out of spirit, not the other way around, a lot of life’s mysteries become much easier to solve. 
B3rnhard, I’ve also meditated on trains, with good results! As for evolution, exactly; to borrow some phrasing from Aristotle, it’s got its efficient cause, the combination of random variation and natural selection that make it happen, but it’s also got its final cause, the patterning of the whole system that guarantees that certain things emerge out of that process (as in convergent evolution). 
Peter, excellent. Fortune doesn’t take it as far as laying out such a comprehensive description, but she provides all the raw materials and tools out of which and by which one can be built. 
Kyle, thanks for this. I’ve heard from quite a number of people who are following along doggedly, but it’s good to hear from someone else that this is helpful.

I am a couple months back and still playing catch up so this is not related to this month’s exploration. The house I moved into had this old hand crank coffee mill that I tried out of novelty, initially finding it unnecessarily slow and frustrating. Now exerting force in a slow circular motion every morning has become my daily cosmic mini meditation. I am so glad that you are doing this because it is likely I would never have heard about this book or given it a second thought if I had skimmed it. Even though I feel a bit handicapped with some of the cryptic sentence structures it’s been life changing so far by helping me accept a greater reality and also acting like “the rug that really ties the room together” for all the other concepts I am/have been exposed to. And to think it all started by showing up to ADR for my weekly doomer fix and somehow I wound up here!

I wonder how humanity traces its lineage in the context of the Cosmic Doctrine? We have the Great Entities creating thought-forms that become solar systems. But “the thought-forms projected by a Great Entity in its turn gave rise to entities,” and the process of entities creating though-forms that give rise to new entities continues on. 
So, once our solar system thought-form became an entity it gave rise to new entities, the planets. Our Mother Earth is then an entity that came into being first as a thought-form created by the solar system. She is its child. Continuing on, life on earth, including humans, would then be entities created first as thought-forms by Mother Earth, who has evolved into an entity with conscious individuality. Mother Earth is, thus, a very good name for her, since she gave birth, via her thought-forms, to all life around us. All the living beings on the planet then are truly our brothers and sisters. A nice thought to remember next time you pet the cat or hug a tree.
Humanity would then be a part of the next lower level of entity creation, life on our planet earth. In our development, are we at the earliest thought-form stage (not yet an entity), or are we thought-forms that have evolved into entities that can participate in this creative evolutionary process? Since we believe that humans have both levels of consciousness, individuality and personality, it would seem that we are entities capable of creating thought-forms, and we participate in the process of Cosmic evolution. The statement “thought are things” is literally true for us then, and I wonder what entities we are responsible for creating?

A couple trains of thought got going from this chapter so far.  I realize I’m jumping the gun a bit by relating it to our own (human) consciousness, but I’m finding that to be the only way I can really make sense of what Fortune is saying.  The first thought relates to what you described in your commentary. The self has a dual nature: one is the background of capacities for reaction, otherwise known as the Individuality, Higher Self, or subconscious.  I have this associated with the ‘hidden’ self, which made me think of the occult – knowledge of the hidden.  The other part of the self is the foreground, Personality, or Lower Self.  Normally we’re only conscious of this part.  In a previous post you mentioned that ‘the collective unconscious that humans experience is identical at its deepest level with the mind of God.”  That got me wondering if the goal of occult work is to become conscious of the knowledge that part of our Self – the hidden self – is actually part of God, or originates from God.
The other train of thought was about the tracks in space.  I’m getting that it takes a lot of practice and repetition to lay down a track in space.  The more the atoms go over it, the deeper and more established it becomes.   In the same way as one learns to play the piano from years of regular practice, laying down the corresponding neural pathways, one’s spiritual development slowly unfolds over years through regular daily practice.  Ritual magic, prayer and meditation practiced regularly serve to establish new tracks in space, or new ways of thinking, corresponding to the new consciousness gained through this work.  The more one practices and uses that new type of consciousness, the deeper the tracks become, until it becomes the familiar, habitual way of responding.  I suppose by the time humanity does come along in Fortune’s model, we wind up just falling into tracks in space that the previous types of atoms have established, but we still have to establish those tracks in our own nervous systems.

Based on the definition of conscious provided here I’m having a hard time thinking of anything that doesn’t count as being conscious. This seems to imply everything is to some extent, in some way shape or form, conscious, at least in the view of the world Fortune had. Am I missing something obvious, or have I just found the perfect theme for a month of meditations?







 Bruno BL says: 



								May 9, 2019 at 6:48 pm							




JMG, correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m beginning to think that most of the challenges I’ve faced in life, specially the recurrent ones (those I’ve failed to deal with sucessfully so far), are a comeback, or leftover, from my previous lives. Which means that I have to deal with those challenges as soon as I am able to, in order to advance cosmically.

Been studying the nature of Vampyres lately for a literary project and so found myself boning up on traditional metaphysics (no pun intended). Came across this beauty by hippy occultist beat poet turned Sufi Mystic Charles Upton. 
http://www.sophiaperennis.com/discussion-forums/traditionalism-and-psychology/principial-psychology-the-tripartite-human-psyche-in-fall-and-restoration/
He speaks of ‘spiritual principles’ Oversoul i am guessing , being cultivated to inform the rational mind to govern the desires. This strikes me as very Platonic.
In the Vampyre, the personality consumed by appetite and desires comes to govern the rational mind. Explains the state of a lot of our leadershio today i think.
He speaks of memory as being of the passive, sentimental type, that of a sulky Vampyre, or of an active type where great images , icons and beliefs are brought to bear. Seems it is possible to turn away from the individuality and the oversoul to become a beast for the remainder of ones short life and then cosmic compost therafter. 
Does this dovetail with Fortunes basic philosophy ? I sense that it does but i hope i am not muddying the waters by discerning between different types of memory.

Cat, I had a similar thought with respect to the reincarnation of a great entity, which I had been interpreting as the sun – how we perceive it on the physical plane. I had been imagining the end of a great entity, either as a supernova, whereupon all the lesser atoms/divine sparks are set out on the next part of their journey around the cosmos. This is also similar to JMG’s thoughts in “The Next 10 Billion Years”. 
However, I got slightly stumped on the symbolism of a black hole. Naturally one would assume that a black hole with its singularity left behind by a supernova of a great entity is either an example of the Unmanifest in our solar system, or the Ring Chaos, or perhaps both. But we interpret the black hole and singularity within our physics as a seriously scary and dark thing, but a singularity is simply also a way of describing what we literally don’t understand. 
So, there’s also every chance that a black hole is what is left behind by a great entity that has reincarnated somewhere else, which also implies that there is a cost to that reincarnation for a great entity – a big sucking void where the Logos was, which will get you into trouble if you get too close.  
But it’s still a great mystery – both within our present physics and for esotericism in general.

Athena, I’ve always had a sense of places, be they houses, forest glens, or neighborhoods.  Before I knew the word “egregor”, I’d be driving down a particular block in the town where I work, and the same feeling would come over me every single time.  My husband, who is a staunch atheist, has similar experiences passing through neighborhoods.  Every forest I’ve ever walked through has its own unique personality and now that I’m more sensitive to it because of my magical studies, the forest often wants to “talk”.  One forest I walk in quite often tells me that it was a dumping ground until midcentury.  We miss each other during the months I don’t walk.  There are no records of it being a dump that I’ve found; however, I know it.  My neighborhood is downtrodden (it’s one of those areas where you ask yourself whether you just heard a gunshot or a firecracker) but it is comforting to me.  Coming home to where the houses start getting more shabby every night is like a warm embrace. The rich neighborhood where I grew up grows increasingly more poisonous when I visit my parents, who still live there. It has the same wistful creepiness with a more recent overlay of unpleasant yuppie/NIMBY clueless glitz.  I used to visit a small lake that could be downright unpleasant.  It wanted to be left alone.  I’d go to the forest nearby because it was more welcoming.  -Kimberly

Gnat, every definition comes down to someone pointing at something and saying “It’s like that.” (In the fancy prose philosophers prefer, that’s pronounced “every definition is rooted in an ostensive act.”)  If you want to know what magic is and how it differs from other things, pick up a couple of decent books on magic, study them, practice the exercises and rituals they teach, and then reflect on your experiences. Otherwise, you’re like someone who’s never had an orgasm, who encounters a definition of an orgasm, and proceeds to insist that a sneeze is an orgasm: after all, a sneeze is a spasmodic contraction that brings about a sense of relief, right? If such a person was good enough at playing the verbiage game, he could defend himself against any attempt by others to tell him that there’s a difference between a sneeze and an orgasm — a difference that’s instantly evident to anyone who’s experienced both, but is hard to express clearly in the blunt-instrument world of verbal definitions without that essential background of lived experience. 
Oh, and no, it’s not true that the consciousness that’s changed in accordance with will by magic is by definition cosmic consciousness. Once again, if you want to know what consciousness operative mages change in accordance with will, you’ll find that out by studying what mages do and how they do it, not by playing with words… 
Athena, an excellent meditation! Thank you. 
Aloysius, glad to hear it. I know the Cos.Doc. is heavy going — it certainly was for me the first time I tried to make sense of it. Thank you for taking it seriously enough to keep at it. 
Dan, good. We’ll be getting into the nature of planets in upcoming chapters; Mother Earth, in the terms you’ve used, is what Fortune calls the Planetary Spirit of the particular planet we’re on, and her emergence and evolution is a little more complex — but again, we’ll get to that. Remember that in the Cos.Doc. cosmology, each of us has at our core a Divine Spark, or in other words one of the Cosmic atoms that accompanied the Great Entity who became our Solar Logos out to the seventh Cosmic plane and joined it in its orbit. In a very real sense, therefore, the Solar Logos is not our father but our elder brother, while the Planetary Spirit is a being of a different kind entirely. More on this as we proceed! 
Stefania, both those trains ran straight to their destinations and arrived on schedule. 😉
Will, I think you’ve found a fine theme for meditations. You know all those mystics and people from traditional cultures who insist that everything is alive and conscious? They’re quite correct. 
Bruno, yep. By the time a soul has been human long enough to be ready to take up some spiritual path, it usually has a bumper crop of tangled karma, and getting that cleared away is an important part of the work of spiritual development. 
Mensch, it takes enormous effort expended over many lives to turn one’s back completely on the higher aspects of existence and become, as you noted, cosmic compost. Fortune has some things to say about that in a later chapter. Most souls go storming away from the Oversoul at some point in one or another kind of passion, slam face first into one painful experience after another, finally get a clue, and wander back — the parable of the Prodigal Son has been used for centuries by Christian occultists as a way to talk about this. Most souls, similarly, spend a number of lives doing the animal thing in human form, since they’ve just graduated from the animal level and that’s what they know how to do. It takes a lot of work, and a lot of suffering, to develop the possibilities that are unique to the human level and then get ready to pass beyond it.

								May 9, 2019 at 8:58 pm							




Who sets the schedule? 😉
On a different topic, I can’t help but think of all the people in our culture who are anti-mystics and say consciousness does not exist. They’ve always baffled me, but I wonder now if they aren’t exactly what I just called them, basing their philosophy on the opposite of the mystic. It’s interesting to think about, since the mystic seeks to become one with God, while the anti-mystic would seek to become God. They sound quite similar, but in reality there is an immense difference.
Seeking to become one with God means trying to find the beauty in the world as is; to embrace existence complete with all the suffering and misery, to see what is, and to see why it is good even with its flaws. This requires reaching out to existence, and learning from it, hearing the stories of the beavers and the lakes, the oceans and the stars. And so, as you listen to the stories, and learn from everything, you see why it is the way it is. You see its history, and how it learned, and thus glimpse the mind behind it.
The anti-mystic, meanwhile, would seek to become God. There is no need to learn from anything, since there’s nothing for God to learn. Thus there’s no point in seeing the mind behind anything. There’s actually no point in seeing the mind in other human beings, since they are nothing more than playthings for God. And once you denied the existence of their minds, is it that much more of a leap to deny your own?
And, the interesting thing is that denying the mind is actually an assertion of power: I am powerful enough to deny something I feel in my bones.

 Cliff says:

I also had thoughts about our solar system’s lifecycle when I was reading this chapter. Our sun won’t have a definitive death via supernova – rather it will grow and shrink as it burns through hydrogen and helium, and eventually it will become a white dwarf for a trillion years or so. So what happens to all the Divine Sparks during that time? 
And at that point I have to shake my head and remind myself that the Cosmic Doctrine isn’t a physics textbook, and at best these are a variety of mental exercises, because there’s simply no way to know.
On another note, when Fortune talks about the Individuality and the Personality, I can’t help but think that she’s laying the groundwork for the explanation of Jesus. In other words, is it off base to consider Jesus as the Personality of the Solar Logos? Or is that another matter entirely?







 David, by the lake says: 



								May 10, 2019 at 7:07 am							




John–
Looking at the three-fold forces of fate, will, and destiny, it would appear that the Individuality would correspond to the first (layered physical, etheric, and astral pasts) and the Personality would correspond to the second (the present, acting consciousness).  Does DF also have a corresponding component for the third? And how would it fit into our geologic metaphor?

Hi John Michael,
I’m still following this journey and cogitating upon the implications. I’m glad that you mentioned reincarnation and memory as that thought had occurred to me too.
I’m assuming that there is a mid-point between memory and reactions and that that is where useful stuff can happen? Also I assume that atoms/individuals can ever so slightly forge their way away from the well trod track and expand the track? Does this action create space in which others can move? And also (apologies for so many questions) is this possibly why actions speak louder than words?
As usual you have provided us with another brain teaser.
Cheers
Chris

It is interesting that the basic pattern of evolution of a Great Entity and a solar system, where the Great Entity ponders and projects thought-forms in an iterative process, is similar to the creation story of Genesis in the Bible. In Genesis, after each day of creation (days 3-7) God pauses and “sees that it is good.” God ponders his thought-forms each day, causing a modification of both them and him as the world is created. To me in the context of the Cosmic Doctrine it means that the God of the Book of Genesis is evolving, just as a Great Entity evolves while creating a solar system. It also reinforces the idea that each of us should reflect on what we have created each day. This process of reflection and conscious creation is called spiritual alchemy in many traditions.

Ah – consciousness! – one of the great mysteries! Reading the CosDoc chapters that describe it and your extremely helpful commentary bring several things to mind. 
First: of the several three-word traditional descriptions of Brahman, my favourite is is ‘sat-chit-ananda’ (roughly translates as ‘being-consciousness-bliss’ – and the order of these words is worth meditating on). Hinduism, however, lacks a single universally accepted description of how this ‘chit’ unfolds in creation. The default assumption is that since Brahman pervades everything, every thing is therefore conscious. The whole process of consciousness evolving first at the biggest levels of ‘being’ and then cascading down to the smaller levels as they are created by the reactions of the Logoidal consciousness, as described in CosDoc, works beautifully and logically and, to my mind, fills the ‘void’ described above. 
Second: the phenomenon of the Divine Sparks evolving more rapidly than the Great Entity, as they recapitulate the lessons learned by the trail-blazing Great Entity reminds me of comments made by Sheldrake regarding how when a newly created substance is formed it takes a relatively long time for it to crystallize, but becomes faster and better structured with each crystallization (even when it is entirely new batches of the newly created substance somewhere else on Earth are the ones being crystallized) – as though the “track in space” is being deepened with each crystallizing event. 
Third: the whole concept of “tracks in space” reminds me of the Hindu concept of ‘vasanas’, which are one’s innate tendencies — born of a repeated (often over numerous lifetimes) action, thought or attitude — and that one of the greatest challenges facing those who strive to liberate themselves from the cycle of birth-and-death is to successfully counter those ‘vasanas’ which oppose liberation and to strengthen those ‘vasanas’ that promote liberation.
Fourth: I love what you said about the Individuality/unconscious self as being the “Higher Self” and the Personality/conscious self as being the “Lower Self”. Western society typically thinks of the conscious as “higher” and unconscious (often referred to as ‘sub-conscious’) as “lower” (for example, the human brain is seen as a highly developed cortex of ‘rationality’ victoriously perched atop the ancient, loathsome, primitive, reptilian brainstem of animal ‘instincts’) – and this has always rubbed me the wrong way. I see the conscious self as being an ephemeral foam-bubble afloat on the unimaginably vast and ancient sea of the unconscious. It’s always to nice to have my ‘radical’ view on the matter vindicated.
Keep up the wonderful work of putting CosDoc into more comprehensible terms and updating the terminology!

								May 10, 2019 at 4:06 pm							




Will, we’ll get to the Lords of Mind, who set the schedules, in a later chapter. 😉 Your distinction between becoming one with God and becoming God is crucial, and a good deal more crisply framed than the fuzzier language I’d been using for the same thing. I assume you realize that this is much of what I’ve been talking about on this blog for months now — the conflict between those who think they can create their own reality and those who realize that their reality created them…
With regard to my comment to Mensch, it’s a little more complex than that, but we’ll get to that process in a later chapter. 
Cliff, Fortune didn’t get into that end of astrophysics. As for Jesus, well, keep in mind that Fortune was a Christian, if a somewhat odd one. She differentiated Jesus the person from Christ the principle; her book Mystical Meditations on the Collects, as I recall, goes into this.

I don’t think this distinction is central just for the past few months: I think an awful lot of what you blog about, and have blogged about since the start, relates to that central point: becoming one with God compared to becoming God; or trying to create your own reality vs knowing reality created you.
I think this is one of the points you’ve hammered home on, trying various ways to approach the point, and I think rightly so: it’s an incredibly important one, and it’s odd to see so many people losing their minds trying to do something impossible.







 John Michael Greer says:

David, the third factor, destiny, is the pattern of tracks in space set in motion by the Solar Logos, which defines the framework of the dance in which the individual entity is engaged. Geologically, it’s what lies beneath the deposited strata, the mantle and the core — what doesn’t change over time. 
Just Me, you’re welcome and thank you! I didn’t get very far with the Cos.Doc. the first time I tried reading it; by the time I made a second attempt, I’d studied systems theory and had met my first teacher in these matters, who put this and a lot of other things in a perspective that helped me make sense of them. My hope is that my books, and this series of posts (which will become a book when it’s finished), will help do that for others. 
Chris, yes, yes, and yes. Every atom that follows a track in space bends and shapes it a little even while following it. I think I’ve mentioned the word “dinergy” before, the interaction between two unequal and not quite opposite forces that produces form; I’ll be talking more about that shortly in the blog. 
Isabel, glad to hear it’s interesting. If a character in one of your future romance novels starts quoting Dion Fortune I’ll be highly amused. 😉
(Come to think of it, Britain in the 1920s makes a good setting for romance fiction, so you could even put Fortune into a story as a minor character…) 
Dan, the similarity is anything but accidental. Western occultists have put centuries of close study into the Book of Genesis. 
Ron, Rupert Sheldrake’s concepts are so close to those of the Cos.Doc. that I’ve wondered rather often whether he studied Fortune’s work but had the great good sense not to mention that fact while publicizing his theory. I hadn’t thought of vasanas — my background in Hindu philosophy is fairly sparse — so that’s good to know. As for the whole notion of the reasoning mind as “higher” and the rest of the mental apparatus as “lower,” yeah, that’s one of the great delusions of the Western world, and is responsible for a lot of pointless suffering and stupidity. 
Shaun, thank you for posting this and I hope you get deluged with favorable responses. 
Matthew, that wasn’t original to me, but I’ve done my best to publicize it. 
Will, very much so, but it’s been particularly central to the posts of the last few months. I’ll be saying more about it next week.







 Cliff says: 



								May 10, 2019 at 11:09 pm							




You’ve also said repeatedly that the Cosmic Doctrine is not a physics textbook, Fortune is just using some of the language of physics to convey a metaphor. So I suppose the underlying question to my musings is, are we locked forever into orbit around the Solar Logos, so that wherever it goes, we go? Or do we get flung off into the greater system around the Central Stillness?
Earlier on in the book, Fortune talks about the complexity of a universe or a Cosmos growing until the contents burst out into the Unmanifest to create new universes. Does she return to this idea?

								May 11, 2019 at 5:08 am							




Hi JMG,
Last year I went to the movies one day and before it started there were two women sitting near me who were having a fairly loud conversation I wasn’t interested in.  The thought crossed my mind that maybe I could some how block the stream if I tried hard enough, so I did, and found I was able to focus so intently on the individual phonetic sounds that the words and sentences would escape me and there would be no comprehension, instead the “conversation” was replaced by a meaningless string of sounds.  This took all of my effort though and if I broke concentration it became sentences again.
I hadn’t thought about this in a Cos Doc sense until your example of the way memory works, but I think there perhaps is a connection.  It is far easier to hear words and comprehend them than it is to break them in this fashion and prevent comprehension, even though it would seem that listening to something and assembling a mental picture from it represents more work than not doing so.  It felt like going against this automatic system of understanding was turning against the cosmos somehow, I was defining a good that went against things set in place in service of the general good of human beings.  That move in context is probably a RIng Chaos move against a basic human ability and towards a void of non meaning, even though for me at that particular time I defined it as a good (ie it was my intent to experience this).  As such the same effort could accomplish so much less in that direction because it will always be the weaker force.
Thanks,
Johnny

Also I wanted to say I was still reading along too.  I stopped commenting because I found this book was just too much in my head and so I couldn’t distinguish what was important enough to say from what wasn’t, I have almost 2 notebooks completely filled with notes from and on it now.  I have focused primarily on the visualization of the geometry, which is the part least natural for me (I actually do think in this way, where I have invisible shapes that make up part of my understanding of some things, but I’ve never tried to mentally build somebody else’s – and certainly not something so specific and odd).  I think I can do this quite well up until somewhere after the point where the atoms get on the stage, although previously I would have included the rings and circles and now I think they flow somewhat naturally from the geometry that precedes them in my imagination.
This week’s essay is the first I’ve been able to understand reasonably well (as in it didn’t just make my head hurt), perhaps from being familiar with your writings, and Sheldrake’s, and also the ideas of Emile Durkheim who suggested religion was a means of instilling a shared moral structure to allow for larger group activities and cohesion.
I’m not sure if others are finding success this way, but it’s helped me to see this text as existing somewhat out of order, and the instruction to visualize the turning of the basic movement as a basic instruction for how to engage with the book, reading it over and over and getting more out of it the more familiar it becomes.  The more I know what she’s getting at the more certain turns of phrase pop out as unusual and seem like clues.
I would say the biggest impact the book has had on me is a shift in my basic understanding of force.  I have long loved something I discovered the Chinese have a word for (Li), which is when you can see the flow of nature evident in things.  For me I just love to see the traces of this all around, and for as long as I can remember I’ve seen the beauty of large natural formations in the small ones around me, almost a type of micro tourism that doesn’t require me to go anywhere.  Anyway, Fortune has shown me that there is not just a force flowing in one direction, it also flows slightly in reverse.  There is a large expansion but also a slight contraction that I never took notice of.
If this force was Schopenhauer’s “will”, then it doesn’t just get as far as it can, but it also draws back into itself a tiny bit.

At the risk of being annoying, I’ll say that this reminds me of the things I liked in Hegel.  Where this is far better is that she is building a tight mental apparatus in this metaphor, so to the degree that I can grasp it, I can actually do new things with it.  I can apply it to problems I have and it provides insight.
For instance, I was thinking about Trump and some of these new politicians on the right and it seems to me that if the left wants to win they have to get under them – by that I mean they have to figure out the greater cosmos that addresses all the issues they do, and then more.  So that rather than say “these guys are wrong” they can say, “Actually Trump (etc) are right, but they do not go far enough”.  If they can successfully find that level they can possibly take all of the momentum as their own and build upon it.
I don’t think Hegel would be useful at all in this context, he maybe shows that these politicians are part of some greater story of history and the result of them will not be apparent until later, but that doesn’t give you an angle for work, it’s more likely to lead you to detachment.
When I reflected on things like collapse I could see that this seemed to be your strategy generally, that rather than try to fight the greater cosmos of declining energy, you could accept that as reality and lean into it, instead voluntarily collapsing and trying to change your thinking and your values so that you like it.  A key for me was when I realized that how we subjectively define good and bad is tied to the alignment of our cosmos, because that is something we are able to change with consideration.

@Will J – when you said “the mystic seeks to become one with God, while the anti-mystic would seek to become God. They sound quite similar, but in reality there is an immense difference.”  
You made me think of thoughts I’ve often harboured about the purported “objectivity” of science, especially when invoked as a denial of personal (subjective) experience as data. 
Because it seemed to me that the only point of view which could plausibly claim to BE objective, universal, unlimited by the hereness and nowness that frames subjective experience, is a “God’s eye” (if God were indeed an omniscient God) point of view. Therefore “seeking to become God” and thereby share in the divine attribute of an “objective” perspective is  EXACTLY what is going on there. 
Thanks for putting that thought down.

Catching up I just finished read Chapter 7. What I’m realizing is I really have no conscious notion of the things set in motion by others actions and/or the tracks of habitual action I may be doing. Now I’m seeing what the point is of meditation, as a way to pause and just observe. Also divination – a way to stop and collect some data and look around. Both allow a way for me to become aware of something that was just going right by me.
I always thought of meditation and divination as as way to “get something for myself” – like peace of mind, or calmness, or insight – thus somehow making me special. Now I see it more like just turning on a light in dark room. The first thing I do when I do that, is look around and observe. Then I do an action of getting something, or reading or whatever.
This is also that strongest reason I have yet to stop social media. The effect of all that input on me – I don’t really know what it is. So much of it is habit, some it is the entertainment, or knowing about a piece of information or joke before others. But what is it doing to me, myself?







 Scotlyn says: 



								May 11, 2019 at 7:02 am							




PS. @Will J. I should add that the perspective I prefer to the “objective” one would be an “inter-subjective” one – one that permits one subject to come to know and work together with another subject. And inasmuch as God could be described as the source of all subjects, the “inter-subjective” perspective might pertain more closely to the  search to know God.

Hi JMG,
Another thing worth mentioning.  Recently a liver pathologist working in stem cells named Neil Theise got interested in some similar territory.  He co-uthored an interesting paper about this concept of “sentience everywhere”, extending from work by Maturana and Varela which suggested all life had sentience, and suggesting their standards, that something can detect external stimulus, evaluate it in some sense (liking or disliking), and respond creatively, actually applies to everything we know.  It will be interesting to reconsider his ideas with Fortune’s specific insights, particularly with regards to the role of creativity vs pattern.  I’ve thought the recent things you’ve said about randomness were valuable and imagine the Cos Doc will help make that clearer (in it’s fashion…)
Theise’s paper for the curious:

“We will first consider the philosophy of Kanada, generally
known as the Vaisheshika Teaching, which inclines toward
an Atomic Theory, akin to that formulated by the old Greek
philosopher Democritus. According to this teaching the
substance of the universe is composed of an infinite number of
atoms, which are eternal, and which were not created by God,
but which are co‑eternal with Him. These atoms, combining
and forming shapes, forms, etc., are the basis of the material
universe. It is held, however, that the power or energy whereby
these atoms combine and thus form matter, comes from God.”

Kimberly, yes! You and I have experienced fascinating similarities, including one of JMG’s essays being cause for breakthrough in understanding what was going on.
And differences, too, which are expanding my mind even as I type this.  You have had great interaction with forests as beings, and I have neglected to ever talk to the whole forests; it’s always been individual trees.  
Yet a couple of my friends have described the same as you, feeling welcomed into individual forests as whole entities, feeling positivity in being present there, and invited back.  Until reading your post, I thought this was the effect of the spirit beings *within* the forest.  But lo my mind is opened: the forest is its own spirit being, too.
***************
On JMG’s essay that blew my mind open and helped me understand what it was that had happened:
First of all, it was this series.
https://www.ecosophia.net/notes-nature-spirits-part-one-nature-nature/
https://www.ecosophia.net/notes-nature-spirits-part-two-living-world/
Second, the backstory here is that I have worked – as have other Ecosophians in the past, I have seen – to save trees.  This is difficult to talk about.  Suffice it to say that the benefits to having participated in this in the human-controlled materialist world have been less than nil, while the resonances from the spirit world – that I wasn’t even expecting, that I did not even know at the time existed – are still reverberating.  
Last year, I began to think of a particular line of large, beautiful old trees along the street located a couple of miles away.  Then I couldn’t stop thinking of them.  Every day, thoughts and images of them floating into my head.  I could not understand it, but finally after a couple of weeks of this I went over there late in the evening when it was dark, so nobody could see me hugging the trees.  
I went one by one, hugged them, said a nice word and wished them well.  I got to the third (of four).  I hugged it.  I looked up.  I could immediately see it was sick.  I had been doing a lot of work to open my third eye over the past several months at that time, so I do not think it was evidence that was visible to the eye, but rather the energy seemed sallow and weakened.  This is a tree that is 150 ft tall and five feet in diameter – there was nothing about it that would look weak to passersby.  I immediately became concerned and – having fairly recently learned about manifestation – set the intention that the tree make a full recovery, shook off whatever illness it had, and was safe.  I used everything in my meager newly minted spiritual arsenal: I prayed to whoever was listening, I asked the Universe, I called on the spirits to help. I visualized all the aspects of the full recovery process strongly, and the tree ultimately returned to full strength and vibrance.  Then I hugged the fourth tree, gave it my blessing as well, and went home.
It was months later when I stumbled on JMG’s essay and was thunderstruck when I now understood what had happened.  Now aware of the presence of nature spirits, I “saw” them in the replay in my mind come to me inside my home, tugging on my clothing, trying to convince me to go with them to see the trees.  They were approximately two feet high and transparent.  They didn’t tell me directly a tree needed my help; perhaps they thought I wouldn’t go if it were for that purpose alone.  They just knew I liked those particular trees and that particular place a lot, and they used that to convince me to go back and see it again, probably knowing once I got there and would be able to see the tree was sick, that of course I would try to help it.  For all I know they were going to every person in the vicinity who had a resonance of caring for trees to try to convince them to come take a look.  I’m not sure what language to use to explain this, but they needed someone on our temporal, third dimensional plane of existence to go and manifest, to set the intention that the tree was healed – to even wish or desire that the tree was healed – so it could recover.

Hello JMG!
In my meditations, when connecting this latest subject with the first, the image that came to me was: what we call the laws of nature/physics/astronomy/magic are “tracks” so large and deep that the whole of the universe runs through their interconnected maze, including those we cannot grasp as humans, which would take us to Mariana trench style profoundity ;P
What lead me to this: the tracks, then, are the universe’s memory, and the three rings his first reactions, with the Central Sun being his uttering “I Am”. Which then cascaded to the 12 rays and the travelling atoms as the universe pondering “Who Am I?”.
Thank you! I see this sessions as you sitting in the ágora with curious minds gathered around to listen and learn.
All the best!

Hi JMG, 
Sorry for being late to the party. 
My brain goes to Nature and Nurture when reading this, and how that happens on so many levels. But this also further emphasizes that Nature is something we build on through Nurture. 
In regard to not being able to really see our Individuality, I’m reminded of one of my favorite quotes, “People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they don’t know is what what they do does.” – Michel Foucault 
Ultimately, on a grand scale, we may never see what our individual actions (our Personality) lead to (our Individuality), it’s an order of magnitude too large for us to see and we are pieces in something much bigger than ourselves. So we focus on what change is occurring here, right now, around us. What we can do, influence, impact, and hope that its waves are good ones over time. 
I think the word “auto-reactions” is an important word to bring up. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking on free will lately, and it seems that free will is most exerted in our Nurture state. 
Also, the first time I heard about Dion Fortune was when reading W.E. Butler’s “The Magician.” He praises her very highly. He writes in his book, “People use the tree of life in different modes, different representations, but by using these expressions, which act on the subconscious mind and are controlled by the conscious mind, we can do magical work. The subconscious is the main agent.” I think that definitely relates here to the discussion of auto-reactions that we build, through our conscious mind and free will, which act on the subconscious, become patterns, and thus lasting change. 
Moving on, I think there’s a lot packed into this paragraph from Fortune:
“Thus each new factor evolved increases the complexity of manifestation, and when the utmost diversity, of
which the factor renders the universe capable, has been arrived at, that phase of evolution has
reached its maximum development, and there is a pause in the process while the Logoidal
consciousness perceives what has taken place, and sees that it is good and by absorbing it into Its
consciousness affects a new reaction, which reaction is, in its turn, projected into the manifested
universe; so that evolution resembles a series of duplicating mirrors wherein the consciousness of
the Logos projects its own image; becomes aware of, and reacts to, the image thus projected; and
the reaction affects the projection, and so the circle is everlastingly revolving.”
What do I see here? Life as a process of building toward complexity. The importance of diversity. A point of maximum development. Reflection. Morality. Rebirth or redirection. The levels of influence and imitation, a passing down. Cycles. 
You can see all of this at many orders of magnitude all throughout everything we experience, from ourselves to our environment to life itself. Even in the goals of magical work. 
In the second chapter, Fortune touches on competing influences. How each of our competing wills, for example, interact and create the courses we take. I think that’s our constant struggle and also one of our greatest gifts. 
I wish I had more questions, but I’m feeling more empowered than confused. 
Although I could draw a diagram, do you know if anyone else has already taken on the task of drawing out the stages which Fortune lays down in this work? Visuals like the Tree of Life have always helped me with study.
With great respect for this space and this discussion,
– RMK

Note: My last comment was a reflection on the messages in Ch. 11 and 12, of the Millennium Edition. References to “the second chapter” are about Ch. 12. Sorry for the confusion. 🙂

Hi JMG
Still reading and contemplating.  Thank you for continuing this study.  One of the things this section has brought up for me on a personal level is if or how this might relate to Dissociative Identity Disorder (previously referred to as multiple personality disorder).  If you feel it is taking the topic away from productive discussion, please feel free not to post.  I was wondering if you had encountered anything in DF’s other writings that might touch on this.  
My own experience with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is that there is an “over-mind” that is aware of all of the things happening to each identity, but the identities are not aware of the memories of the other identities at the time that they are active.  As I have become older and remembered things in my life that were too overwhelming to deal with at the time the identities have seemed to merge.  I know that there are at least some people who seem to have multiple identities that are aware of each other that have decided not to merge. 
I’ve wondered if “DID” could be like an intra-life experience of reincarnation.  But I also wonder what implications a set of personalities that are not very aware of each other, in particular consciously aware of each other’s memories, would have on reincarnation.  And for that matter what impact suppressing memories of unpleasant events might have on reincarnation.
Don’t want to move discussion into a sub-niche, but I was wondering how DF would approach this.
Thanks,
Candace

The same day I saw Will J’s comments about “becoming God” versus “becoming one with God,” and JMG’s responses, I also learned about the Ecomodernist movement, whose core concept is “decoupling.” That is, striving to decouple human activity from the natural world, to the supposed benefit of both.
Four thoughts ensued, in rapid succession.
1. I suppose it should be no surprise that Ecosophia would have a polar opposite somewhere.
2. Seems very Radiance-like too.
3. The dichotomy of becoming-one-with versus detachment-from, on all levels, is a surprisingly big deal. A major spiritual divide. Perhaps THE main spiritual divide of our time and times soon to come.
4. Said divide goes right through my own life in various ways. Which might be the beginning of understanding why I’ve been where I’ve been and why I am where I am.
Some of that isn’t expressed well. If it relates to this coming week’s topic maybe I’ll be able to clarify.

@ Athena:
“But lo my mind is opened: the forest is its own spirit being, too” 
You might want to look up the “Wood Wide Web”, There are some mind-blowing videos on YouTube, all based on thorough scientific evidence. Suzanne Simard is good, as she’s one of the actual researchers, and a good speaker.

I would also like to say thank for this series of post about the Cos Doc.  I don’t think I would have made it through on my own and find my thoughts slow to form about what we read each month.  So much to ponder.  I also find the comments and insights of other to be really valuable too.  Your exchange with Will J was really enlightening to me.

@WaltF, regarding the Ecomodernist movement: Well, there goes my good mood for the day. 
Here are some chestnuts from the Ecomodernist Manifesto (http://www.ecomodernism.org/):
“Despite frequent assertions starting in the 1970s of fundamental ‘limits to growth,’ there is still remarkably
 little evidence that human population and economic expansion will outstrip the capacity to grow food or procure critical material resources in the foreseeable future.”
“To the degree to which there are fixed physical boundaries to human consumption, they are so theoretical
 as to be functionally irrelevant. […] Human civilization can flourish for centuries and millennia on energy delivered from a closed uranium or thorium fuel cycle, or from hydrogen-deuterium fusion. […] Given plentiful land and unlimited energy, substitutes for other material inputs to human well-being can easily be found if those inputs become scarce or expensive.”
“Greater resource productivity associated with modern sociotechnological systems has allowed human societies to meet human needs with fewer resource inputs and less impact on the environment.”
It’s a remarkable sleight of hand that depicts the Native Americans as ecological monsters for eating meat, while modern Americans are to be applauded because their big screen TVs and cubicle farms and SUVs are slightly less wildly disastrous than they might have been.

Peter, thanks for the thoughts about black holes–they have always been fascinating to me, and now I will have even more fodder for mediation as I think about the esoteric implications of their existence.

@ Cliff, et. al.
Re the Ecomodernist Manifesto
I’ll go through it again more thoroughly, but my first response on the initial read-through was an overwhelming sense of hubris.  Could we be any more arrogant?
A marked contrast to the notions we’re studying in Cos Doc, for sure.

@Cliff,
I didn’t set out to ruin anyone’s mood, so my apology for that. Only a half-hearted one, though, because I find the juxtaposition, along with WillJ’s and JMG’s recent comments, so clarifying. There’s a limit to the horror of something that’s merely repellent. Deeper horror has to have an enticing quality to it. Recycling a bottle instead of tossing it in a meadow; isn’t that “decoupling,” and isn’t it a good thing?
Our host’s public writings have been addressing the material impossibility of large-scale decoupling since their beginning. In direct response to the Ecomodernist manifesto, George Monbiot and Chrise Smaje, among others, have posted cogent criticisms of decoupling as a political agenda. (In a nutshell: the verb becomes transitive, as in, “we’re here to decouple you from your land.”)
But even supposing it were actually achievable in some moral and equitable way, decoupling is a false path. The spiritual divide I’m seeing (relevant to this week’s topic and discussion) was poetically framed by Italo Calvino in Invisible Cities in 1972. One of the cities, in fact the “central” one in the novel’s mathematical schema, is Baucis, which is elevated at a stratospheric height on long stilts above a large tract of otherwise uninhabited forest.
Nothing of the city touches the earth except those long flamingo legs on which it rests and, when the days are sunny, a pierced, angular shadow that falls on the foliage.
There are three hypotheses about the inhabitants of Baucis: that they hate the earth; that they respect it so much they avoid all contact; that they love it as it was before they existed and with spyglasses and telescopes aimed downward they never tire of examining it, leaf by leaf, stone by stone, ant by ant, contemplating with fascination their own absence. (1978 translation)
Decoupling represents and realizes all three of those hypotheses which are actually one and the same.

Ecomodernist?  Amazing!   What could possibly go wrong?







 Cliff says: 



								May 14, 2019 at 11:10 pm							




@WaltF: I was being tongue-in-cheek about my mood getting ruined. If anything, I was delighted to find something concrete I can point to when I’m trying to talk to someone about this.
Those are good points about the deep horror and the forceful decoupling, and I’ll have to meditate on them. 
Also, I have Italo Calvino’s book on my to-read list; I may have to bump it up.
@David BTL: Yes, the hubris was pretty intense. To think that there are no limits to our expansion and no cost to our actions; to think that we can meddle with a half-billion year old biosphere of immense complexity and walk away unscathed.

@ Bogatyr,
Wow, thank you for the recommendation to look up Wood Wide Web.  A quote from Simard’s presentation transcript that resonates: 
“But there were also critics who tried to discredit my work. In fact, there were a lot of papers written, keynote addresses given, press releases. And back home, a professional ethics letter was actually put on my file. My work was called “a dog’s breakfast.”
“I know that you know that this kind of intimidation is actually not that uncommon with breakthrough science, especially if it challenges the status quo.”
Reading: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-wood-wide-web/478224/ – The 1997 study, “Net transfer of carbon between ectomycorrhizal tree species in the field,” is linked within.
Simard’s treatment at the hands of the scientific establishment is reminiscent of what paleontologist Gerta Keller has gone through: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/dinosaur-extinction-debate/565769/

Child prodigies getting younger and younger?  Videos like the one attached here seem to indicate that.  A few people responding to this video on another discussion board saw this as “proof” of the doctrine of reincarnation.  But it could also be that this particular “rut” is getting worn pretty deep after several centuries of advancing violin technique, and that this particular “atom” has entered it very early.  At any rate, the video is amazing.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YipD8Npugvg

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Beginnings of Mind 
June 12, 2019June 12, 2019John Michael Greer42 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your seat belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 12, “The Beginnings of Mind,” pp. 55-58.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 13, “The Beginnings of Mind and Group Consciousness,” pp. 77-81.
Commentary:
This chapter is trickier than most, and has to be read carefully in order to dodge a pitfall or two and find the trail Fortune has marked out. I suspect, for what it’s worth, that this is entirely deliberate. Whenever the text of The Cosmic Doctrine comes close to certain of the secrets of practical occultism, Fortune does something of the kind.  That was standard practice among occult authors in her time, and she herself defended the practice in her writings. Times have changed, and a great many things that were secret in her time can be found splashed all over the internet in ours; that was one of the reasons I decided it was time to write a commentary on the Cos. Doc. that’s noticeably less reticent than the original text.
Fortune starts out by drawing a distinction between objects, on the one hand, and the tracks in space left by the movements of objects, on the other. An object moves and then comes to rest, but the track in space left by the movement keeps on flowing. These two things, concrete objects and abstract movements of space, form the two halves of the universe we experience. Atoms in motion form the half we call matter, substance, manifestation; pure movements apart from atoms and other objects form the half we call spirit, mind, consciousness.
Did you spot the trap? Atoms are themselves pure movement, as Fortune explains repeatedly in the first part of this book. Movement and space, between them, are all there is. Thus the distinction between objects and tracks in space is more apparent than real. Objects are tracks in space that, through repetition, have settled down into a stable condition. The tracks in space that still look like pure movement apart from objects are those that haven’t yet gone through all their changes.
One important implication is that what is spirit, mind, consciousness today, if it sustains itself over time, becomes matter, substance, manifestation tomorrow. We explored that same point earlier in a different context, when talking about the difference between the Individuality (the part of the self that endures from life to life) and the personality evolved in each life. The point applies more generally, though. Understand it in its fullness and you grasp the necessity of repetition and rhythm in operative occultism.
With that point made, or rather hinted at, Fortune turns at once to the narrative of the solar system’s development she’s been tracing out since Chapter Seven. On the Cosmic side of things, we have the Solar Logos, once a traveling atom moving through the Cosmos and now the center of a solar system, and we have the Cosmic atoms that were swept up with the Solar Logos on its journey out to the seventh Cosmic plane, and now circle around the Logos. From this point on references to the Cosmic atoms will be relatively sparse in our text.
This is because we have passed from the Cosmos to the solar system: in effect, into the dream the Solar Logos dreams as it orbits the central stillness. That dream is our reality. Though each of us has a Cosmic atom at the core of our being, we don’t wake from the dream until we have passed through an entire cycle of evolution.
Within the dream, the phenomena of the solar sytem itself take center stage.  Those consist, first, of the tracks in space laid down by the uncoordinated movements of the Cosmic atoms, which (since any repeated movement ends up becoming a manifested reality) become atoms in their own right, the raw material out of which the solar system will take shape. Second, we have the tracks in space laid down by the dance of the Solar Logos, which reflect the Logoidal experience of the Cosmos and draw the atoms of the solar system into their pattern.
Those are the ingredients of a solar system. Because the consciousness of the Solar Logos has been imprinted with the rhythms and patterns of the Cosmos, its dance imitates the Cosmos, and everything else in its solar system is drawn into that imitation and become parts of a Cosmos in miniature. At the center, in place of the Central Stillness of the Cosmos, is the Solar Logos, and the same pattern of Rings, Circles, and Rays discussed in the commentary to the first part of The Cosmic Doctrine is recreated anew on a smaller scale.
That process doesn’t happen all at once. Remember that the Solar Logos is still part of the Cosmos, and is constantly being influenced as it follows its orbit on the seventh Cosmic plane around the Central Stillness by the Rays through which it passes and by other Great Entities on higher Cosmic planes. Each of these things causes adjustments in the movements of the Logos—that is to say, in the Logoidal consciousness, for in Fortune’s metaphor mind and movement are the same thing—and these adjustments cause corresponding adjustments in the dance of the atoms about the Logos.
Thus the Logos moves in its immense and intricate dance; one after another, the movements of the dance lay down tracks in space; through repetition, the tracks become enduring currents of space, and begin to influence the movements of objects that encounter them. One after another, the structures of the Cosmos are mirrored in the newborn solar system, and every object in the solar system is drawn into those patterns and begins to absorb the imprint of the Cosmos to at least some degree.
The objects that matter most at this stage of the process are the secondary atoms—the atoms created by repeated movements in the solar system, not the Cosmic atoms that existed before the solar system was born. As in the Cosmos, so in the solar system, some atoms are more complex than others.  They sort themselves out in exactly the same way, most of them settling out into seven planes, which can be imagined as great concentric circles orbiting the Solar Logos.
(A note on planes is probably in order here.  In the Rosicrucian occult philosophy that provides the unstated subtext for The Cosmic Doctrine, there are seven great Cosmic planes, six of which are completely outside our knowledge and understanding; everything we are capable of knowing about exists on the seventh Cosmic plane. The seventh Cosmic plane is divided into seven planes, which are the planes on which our spiritual evolution takes place.
(Each of the seven planes is divided in turn into seven sub-planes or regions; the physical plane, for example, is divided into the solid region, the liquid region, the gaseous region, and four etheric regions, the chemical ether, the life ether, the light ether, and the reflecting ether. Fortune’s students learned all this material from the standard occult literature of the time, and some of the details of The Cosmic Doctrine make more sense if you keep the Cosmic planes, the planes, and the sub-planes separate in your mind.)
There’s an interesting reversal between the Cosmos and the solar system that needs to be kept in mind here as well.  In the Cosmos, the seventh Cosmic plane, where the most complex Cosmic atoms settle out, is the plane furthest from the Central Sun. In a solar system, by contrast, the seventh plane is the one nearest the center, and thus closest to the Logos. This is one of the ways that a solar system is a Cosmos turned inside out.
This is crucial here because not all the atoms of the solar system settle out into the seven planes. Some are too complex and become traveling atoms, like the traveling atoms of the Cosmos but on a far smaller scale. The traveling atoms, like their Cosmic equivalents, have a more complex destiny than their simpler cousins; they are imprinted by the Logoidal consciousness—and since this has been conditioned by the Cosmos, the traveling atoms of the solar system receive at second hand the same Cosmic imprint as the traveling atoms of the Cosmos.
In the metaphor, of course, that’s expressed in terms of motion. So you have great numbers of secondary atoms that are too complex to settle out in any of the seven planes of the solar system, and each of these dances in rhythm with the Solar Logos. The dance, as it repeats itself, becomes a track in space echoing the thoughts of the Logos. So these traveling atoms become twofold entities: a complex atom, with a track in space laid down by its attunement with the Logos which governs the motion of the atom.
Since that track in space is pure motion, it is of the same nature as the motions of the Logos and can interact in some sense with the Logoidal consciousness. Since it has been shaped by the motions of the Logoidal consciousness, it contains in embryonic form all the possibilities for reaction that the Logos itself evolved during its long ages as a traveling atom of the Cosmos. The secondary atoms that settle into place in the seven sub-planes have that same potential, but since they don’t come into direct contact with the Logos the potential remains unfulfilled for the time being. In the traveling atoms, that potential becomes a reality. In this way, as already noted, God makes man in His image and likeness.
So we have our secondary traveling atoms. Each one is a set of movements that has become stereotyped through repetition and now acts like an object. Each one also picks up a new set of movements absorbed from the dance of the Solar Logos, which gives it a set of new possibilities for reaction and memory—which, as my readers will recall, is Fortune’s definition of consciousness. Finally, each of these atoms begins to attract other atoms into its dance. These latter are not traveling atoms but ordinary stay-at-home atoms of the seventh plane. These form a body, the seventh-plane body of a new kind of entity.
The original traveling atom is called the seed atom, and Fortune calls it “the beginnings of a vehicle.” The term “vehicle” was much used in the occultism of her time where nowadays occultists prefer “body.” It is overshadowed by the track in space that guides its motions and those of its seventh plane body. As we’ll see, this track in space has a special destiny. If the seventh-plane atoms attracted by the seed atom are the first foreshadowings of a body, the track in space is the first foreshadowings of a spirit, and the composite being made up of these three things is an entity capable of evolution.
Each such entity is a reflection, within the solar system, of a Cosmic atom which is the spiritual essence of that entity. As already noted, Fortune will have little to say about the Cosmic atoms in much of what follows, but they should not be forgotten. The Cosmic atom was there before the solar system was born and will be there after it has dissolved; it enters into manifestation in a solar system for an entire evolution the way a soul enters a body for a single incarnation—and the composite form made up of a seed atom, a track in space, and a seventh plane body is the most basic form of its embodiment, the form you had at the beginning of your own journey through the realms of manifestation.
That’s a key theme to keep in mind as we proceed. We are not talking about things that happened to some other kind of being in some other Cosmos far, far away. What Fortune is trying to communicate, using the nearest approximate metaphor, is your own spiritual biography, the immense journey that brought you to the beginning of this life: as Iolo Morganwg’s Barddas puts it, “through every form capable of body and life to the state of man.” As we proceed further, the applicability of Fortune’s great metaphor to our individual lives will become increasingly clear.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on July 10.  Until then, have at it!

“…a solar system is a Cosmos turned inside out.” This reminds me of the medieval view of the cosmos from Lewis’ “The Discarded Image,” where in the spiritual world God is at the center and humanity at the periphery, but in the physical world the Earth is at the center and God is diffused across the entire heaven. I wonder if there’s a lineage here?

It occurred to me since quite a while that many ideas in the Cosmic Doctrine, which were already discussed here, seem to have something to do with the subject of reincarnation. I didn’t comment on the Cosmic Doctrine, but I do follow the discussion and read the chapters.

Thank you for this elucidation. It occurs to me that many, if not all, Fortune metaphors such as “tracks in space” are pointers to things beyond our immediate understanding or ken.
As I study and ponder CDoc, I can’t help but sensing that all the metaphors point to an incredibly dense “probability space” of which the first principle is Stillness ie Unmanifest prior to Cosmos,  the second principle is uncaused motion, and the third principle is Patterns ie emerging consciousness, memory, matter, i.e Manifestation. 
Every probability in Manifestation seems conditioned by prior probabilities, perhaps that’s why we are “in the image”. Qaunta, coherence, resonance, dissonance all make sense in terms of probability — ie without light, space, and time separating “objects” then everything would just be a big pile of brown **** lol.
Anyhow, I merely mention this because as you note, metaphors taken literally are self-limiting, and uncaused but conditioned patterns in probability make more sense, to me at least.

A confession and a revelation.  The confession is that around chapter 6 or 7, I lost my copy of the revised edition. I doggedly read all the subsequent posts, but became more and more lost.  
The revelation is this.  Last week, knowing I had a couple of lengthy bus journeys ahead of me, I printed off a new copy, and used the bus journeys to read through chapters 1 to 12.  Revelation.  It is all beginning to be, dare I say, approachable.  (I won’t say I suddenly understand it all, that would be far too overconfident).  But, I found myself able to read through, make images in my mind, say things like “oh, of course” and such, without feeling that I was encountering a strange language, as I had done initially.   I suspect that the “tracks in space” that have been left by participants in this very reading group played a big part in this sense of increased ease of comprehension. 
Now that I have “caught up” with a fast reading, I will be going back to a slow reading, bit by bit. 
Meanwhile, may I mention a couple of bits from previous chapters that caught my particular attention in this “catch up” reading?
1) From Chapter VI:
“…and  such  process  continues  until  such  time  as the  organisation  of  the  Cosmos  becomes so  mighty in the  force  it  has  generated,  that  it  bursts  the  Ring-Pass-Not,   and   the   Great   Organisms  rush  forth  into  the  Unmanifest,  and  by  their  swirling  movement  gather   ” space”  about  them  and,   in  their  turn,  build new “Cosmoi”. Such is the story of Cosmic evolution.”
I think that if any mention of a Ring-Pass-Not “bursting” has been mentioned in these posts, I must have missed it.  So, I’m guessing that in the fractal way of things, whenever a three-ring system modelled on the Cosmos, reaches the end of its evolution, this is a death of that system, and death occurs by the bursting of its Ring-Pass-Not and the contents so carefully concentrated and built up within it “rush forth” to become material for other systems.  This would be what happens to a cell, for example, when it dies.
2) From Chapter VII:
“…you start where God leaves off…”
This is actually startling, but also thrilling, and has led to some fruitful cycle thoughts.
3) From Chapter VIII
“…the  absence  of  sensation  to   which  the  presence    and    continuance    of    habituated    reactions    in    their    accustomed  ordered  sequence  alone can  give  rise…”
This immediately struck me as a definition of what we consider “health”.  Mainly because people consult me clinically when something UNaccustomed and NONhabituated occurs and produces an uncommon stimulus demanding their attention – pain, altered functions, etc.  When a person is not receiving any non-habitual signals from their body, that is to say, it is as if sensation is absent, while “continuance of habituated reactions in their accustomed ordered sequence” are present, they consider themselves healthy.  And, can give their entire attention to the world around them, rather divide it between the world and the demands upon attention that an unhealthy body issues.
Anyway, I am back as an active participant in this study, and thankful to be so.

Would it be correct to make an analogy between the Solar System and its Atoms on the one hand and the development of an Ideology/Paradigm and the people that think with it on the other? Therefore the mechanics described by Dion Fortune provide a model of the co-evolution between viewpoints and individuals? And from the perspective of an occultist, a clear understanding of the model, validated by actual practice, can provide points of leverage to influence their evolution while still keeping in mind that the process has its own dynamics that cannot be fully controlled?
There is something quite meta about this entire Cosmic Doctrine line of collective study…

Have you ever heard of Human Design? What you describe seems almost directly analogous with a different jargon. 
The basic split of atoms (matter) and spirit (abstract movements of space) would, in Human Design, be matter and dark matter. 
The three ingredients to form reality – a seventh plane body, a seed atom, a track in space, are described in Human Design as the Design Crystal, Personality Crystal, and Profile (the geometry you traverse in this life adhered to by the Magnetic Monopole).
You even say “these traveling atoms become twofold entities: a complex atom, with a track in space laid down by its attunement with the Logos which governs the motion of the atom” which describes the BodyGraph, with its greater whole than the sum of its parts.
I ask if you have heard of it because I wonder if I could have understood your/Fortune’s descriptions of reality without the metaphysical framework I’ve gleaned from Human Design. And because the two adhere so well, I have to acknowledge Fortune really was on to something, trying to find the language for it. Excellent dissection of Fortune’s work on your part!

This was a hard chapter to fathom. I had to read it, look at your notes, then read it again, then think about some of the ideas. One of the thoughts that seemed clear to me through the reading, is that of the reflection of the Cosmos in the Solar Logos and then again in the traveling atoms that follow the Solar Logos.  And in that, I begin to connect the thoughts of microcosm and macrocosm in my current studying of Circles of Power. On the one hand, we are seeing the Cosmos indirectly, and may not be able to grasp it fully; on the other hand, we have more potential here than we may realize: “Thus it is that the traveling atoms of a universe contain the potentialities of reaction of which the nature of the Logos is capable.”

								June 12, 2019 at 5:00 pm							




Reading this chapter a couple of days ago, I found it more impenetrable than usual.  I’m relieved to find out it wasn’t just me.  I’ll continue with the attempt and see what transpires.

“One important implication is that what is spirit, mind, consciousness today, if it sustains itself over time, becomes matter, substance, manifestation tomorrow.”
abbreviated:
“…consciousness today… becomes… manifestation tomorrow”.
Ah!!
Aha!!
And this is precisely because manifestation is a sort of density of movements “in the abstract” which when less dense are still more diffuse consciousness.   
And that density comes from repetition and rhythm, deepening particular tracks in space until they are dense enough to be “held constant” and manifest.
Magic.
In a word.

								June 12, 2019 at 6:03 pm							




Following on from Scotlyn’s comment can I paraphrase a thought? ‘That which was not possible before, becomes possible.’ Somewhere, ‘memory’ makes recognition possible? This reminds me of something. If we might try a poetic way of telling the story? Where we end and sources begin, water issues fresh from the ground, Mnemosyne the mother of the muses starts Calliope on the epic adventure to the sea.

A lot of different thoughts came up for me with this chapter. The traveling atoms are different from the other atoms (the ‘inanimate atoms’).  Unlike the inanimate atoms, they’re not just moving around randomly reacting to the influences of the solar system and the other atoms around it. They move with a definite circular rhythmical motion. There is structure to their motion and hence, their thoughts. They’re not swinging from one extreme mood to the other – happy, sad, angry, peaceful; rather they have reached equilibrium. Fortune says “These travelling atoms have escaped from the laws of the manifested universe which bind into forms.”  To me this signifies the laws of the material plane. Taking some themes from the Kybalion, they don’t escape the causation or structure of the higher planes but fall in with the higher laws, and thus master circumstances on the lower plane.   They’re free from the endless back and forth motion or rhythm of the emotions on the lower plane, or at least they can avoid being controlled by it.
The travelling atoms’ motion or thought is structured due to their contact with the Logoidal ideas.  Something in them has awakened and become active – higher aspects of their consciousness, higher planes of awareness similar to that of the Logos.  They’re now acting in accordance with the imprint or mold of the Cosmic order, following the Logoidal plan, having more of an understanding of the Logoidal consciousness and how things operate in the universe.  They have been bathed in the Logoidal ideas – like being baptized or initiated into a different way of being, or receiving the emanations of the Holy Spirit as it descends; the light that was before the worlds.  They are receptive to the divine order of things, like the geomantic character of Gwyn – a cup being filled from above, from a higher order of consciousness.  It’s like the Logos is trying to teach them his song, and they gradually come to learn it by induction, through their evolution through the universe.  “They have imparted to them by the Logoidal vibrations, the same rhythm as the Logos is vibrating to.”  
It would seem that the Logos would like us to be emulating its plan or song for the universe, not just bouncing around at random doing our own disconnected thing.  Like what JMG has been discussing recently – how we don’t just create our own reality out of whole cloth, we co-create it with the Logos based on the framework for the universe.  It has structure and limits.  It’s possible to be receptive to that imprint and embark on our creative endeavors from within it. Sometimes we think we can sing our own song, but it’s not really so.  We’re meant to be a part of the Logoidal song and hence, the song of the entire Cosmos.  
I notice how the whole process then repeats itself, in that the travelling atoms don’t just relax in the warm glow of the Logos, but they start having a similar effect on the inanimate atoms as the Logos had on them.  They draw them around themselves.  I was reminded of the stories about how Jesus through his activism attracted his disciples and many followers into orbit around him, as though with personal gravity.

RPC, hmm! I don’t know, but it’s a possibility worth exploring. 
Booklover, excellent. Yes, that’s one of the things the metaphor is about. 
Jeff, that’s certainly one way to make sense of it. One of the useful things about Fortune’s decision to frame the discussion in overtly metaphoric terms is that it allows plenty of room for individuals to frame things in terms that make sense to them. 
Scotlyn, delighted to hear it. I suspect your newfound ability to make sense of the Cos.Doc. is also simply a function of repetition — after a certain number of encounters with the concepts, they leave tracks in your mental space…
Erick, give it a try and see how well it works! “Meta” is a good label for this sort of symbolic philosophy. 
Togaj, no, I haven’t — there are lots of recently hatched pop-occultism groups out there, and I haven’t really tried to follow them. It sounds as though Human Design took some of the standard concepts of occult philosophy and gave them new names borrowed from various sciences. Still, if it works for you, by all means. 
Cat, no question, this is heavy going. You’ve caught an important concept, though — the way that the Cosmos mirrors itself down the planes into smaller and smaller microcosms is a crucial element of the occult vision of things. 
Phutatorius, no, it’s not just you. This is one of the tougher chapters. 
Scotlyn, ding! We have a winner. You now understand one of the basic principles of operative occultism. 
Phil, good. Yes, that would also be a good metaphor! 
Stefania, a fine meditation. Thank you.

Hello John (& All), I recently completed an initial reading of, The Cosmic Doctrine, as per your recommendation. My mind is now entirely blown!! Felt attuned with a force of transcendence, sacredness & beauty while reading. After I let the concepts percolate awhile, I will reread the book & your related blog posts. Got more of that medicine!? 😉 Are there other books which you consider to be of such stature & profound significance in the occult genre? Thanks for all your blog posts & books. You contribute an invaluable service.

“So that each moving atom in the universe, by its movement, creates a counterpart of itself, of the same type of existence as that which forms the Cosmos, therefore of the same nature as the Logos of its universe.”  
I think it is difficult to underestimate the seriousness of the implications of the former paragraph.  It’s a bit… terrifying.  Every choice is a test.  Every moment is a fork in the road.  A seemingly simple trip to the grocery store, school day, or walk in the forest brings a new world to life — each tiny experience shapes the trajectory of the soul.  No wonder so many people report having the “back in school” recurring dream.  We’re all in school for an eternity.  All of those people with Trump Derangement Syndrome (especially the ones throwing around bad intentions with amateurish, half-hearted magic) are doing a real number on themselves, because now I see they are creating mental prisons of delusion and hysteria from which it could easily become impossible to escape from within a single incarnation. Clearly magic exists whether one believes in it or not.

One important implication is that what is spirit, mind, consciousness today, if it sustains itself over time, becomes matter, substance, manifestation tomorrow.
One thing this reminds me of, besides the daily practice of a banishing ritual, is the dumb definition of insanity that people like to trot out: Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
I’ve had the thought for a while now that this is also the definition of practice. I suppose the difference between practice and insanity is knowing what results a pattern of behavior will produce. For instance, wanting to lose weight through undergoing crackpot diets, versus wanting to promote health through daily exercise.
So… what leads a person to begin scrutinizing the links between their behaviors and the outcomes? Because gods know this is not a universal quality.
Though each of us has a Cosmic atom at the core of our being, we don’t wake from the dream until we have passed through an entire cycle of evolution.
Would this be the equivalent of reaching Gwynfydd?

Hi JMG and all,
I’m one of those people who is still keeping up with the book club in read-only mode. It normally takes me a couple of weeks of daily grappling with each chapter before I start getting any sense out of it. And even then, the sense rarely comes in during the grappling sessions – most of the time it’s through some other activities. This means that I don’t have much to contribute to the conversation and even when I do it’s too late – we are moving to the next chapter. Nothing to complain about though. I enjoy the process and I intend to stay on this train until the last stop! :}
One thing I noticed is that, while the material is becoming less accessible as we go, the metaphors become easier to correlate to my experience – they feel less and less abstract. It was mentioned a couple of Cos Doc posts ago that Unmanifest is relative rather than absolute and it came home to some extent to me while digging through the previous chapter.
In some way, for human Personality, until it gets involved into some honest spiritual work and does it for a while, Individuality is as good as Unmanifest – it doesn’t seem to exist. This relativity doesn’t seem to be stopping at the human level. I was meditating on one of my behavioral quirks a couple of weeks ago and it brought me to a part of myself that I’ve rejected in early childhood. We ended up having a lively conversation and through that I learned that the mechanism or rejecting and then projecting this part of myself outside of myself was in some way similar to my human personality being born and developing as if separately from my Individuality. And now, as I, as human level Personality, work towards Individuality, in a similar fashion, that part of me, that was rejected in the past, is working towards me. Me, as human Personality, to it is Individuality and for a good few decades I was for it as good as Unmanifest.
Once again, thank you for making this reading easier for us. And thanks to everyone who is orbiting around this book club for supporting an engaging vibe of learning. :}

Hi, JMG – well, this is all putting a new complexion on the deep resistance my Protestant soul still expresses towards ritual, which I may have mentioned in earlier threads. 
I was brought up to think of candles, incense, rote prayers, ritual services and etc, as props or crutches for people who lack a direct connection to God, and although my theological ideas have undergone profound changes throughout my 40 years or so of adulthood, I find myself still quite nervous around actual “rhythm and repetition” and all its relations, in practice.
If I may, the SOP, being amenable to change, and to an individual approach, and not too overly rigid, manages to permit me to practice without too much resistance.  Still, there are many aspects of ritual and ceremony that I struggle to approach. 
I think I shall be putting this insight to work in the next wee while,  developing rituals that I myself can more readily participate in.

Hi John Michael,
I’m slowly working through your essay. I did notice that your quote: “its dance imitates the Cosmos, and everything else in its solar system is drawn into that imitation and become parts of a Cosmos in miniature.”
It sort of indicates that there is a sort of overall pattern and/or more interestingly – links. Perhaps a good analogy is that: much in the way evolution changed mammals from small rodent like creatures during the days of the dinosaurs, to the sort that you see today – like us, it happened because it was both a possibility in this solar system and part of the larger dance. So I presume, but of course knowing that we cannot know, other solar systems would have different dances?
And further, there is an ongoing accumulation – but with no certainty of the path or manifestation both of which could diverge – as the cosmic atom proceeds along its journey?
Despite having grown up reading dodgy pulp sci-fi, I have little interest in space these days and I’m firmly of this planet in desire as well as in a more practical understanding of the concept. Some people feel otherwise, but I disagree with them. The metaphor for this story doesn’t work well with my brain for some reason, and my mind keeps coming back to a series of stories between an elder and an initiate. Dunno why, can’t explain it, but the space stuff jars my perceptions in this context. It could well be written using another metaphor – and that isn’t a criticism, but just an observation.
Cheers
Chris

I started reading the Cos Doc along with your posts last year but had to let it go during Chapter 4 when I had too much else going. Now I’m back, having worked through Chapters 1 through 3 again in the past few weeks and currently working through Chapter 4, the building of the atom. It’ll probably take a few months to get through the earlier chapters, but eventually I’ll catch up with the discussions here.
What struck me as I visualized through all the metaphors of these first few chapters is how apt the metaphor of moving space now seems to me. If I’m not paying close attention, I think of myself and the not-myself as solid objects. But when I sit down in meditation and experience myself from the inside, I don’t feel solid at all. There is something different about the feeling in the part of the leg pressing against the chair, for instance, but inside the body, it really doesn’t feel like anything solid; it’s evanescent. Movements in space, in other words. In the scientific metaphor, the solar system and the atom are mostly empty space as well. Even a subatomic particle isn’t solid in the Newtonian sense. Fortune’s moving-space metaphor, with the different kinds of Cosmic atoms forming and whirling around, seems a great deal more apt now than it did when I first encountered the metaphor last year.
BTW, my success in improving my visualization skills through the Dolmen Arch course work in the last several months have made it much easier to visualize Fortune’s imagery in the Cos. Doc.

I do understand Scotlyn’s point about ritual and ceremony quite well, because nowadays, it is quite difficult for cultural reasons (the current situation of religion and rationalism) to find an healthy approach to these things and spirituality. This is one point in favor of Druid magic: it seems to be relatively flexible.

“One important implication is that what is spirit, mind, consciousness today, if it sustains itself over time, becomes matter, substance, manifestation tomorrow.”
This seems rather horrible. If consciousness becomes matter, isn’t that like death? And isn’t it a downgrade?

The thing that caught my attention here most was the bit about the travelling atoms not being bound by the same rules once they go out to the furthest boundary and return. It tracks with a lot of what I’ve been meditating on about the Path of Tau and the journey to the underworld, and about travel itself–that experiencing places or modes different from what you’re used to makes you better able to discern between the rules/standards that always apply, the ones where there’s some wiggle room, and the ones that are just weird byproducts of a particular time/place/history and make no sense. It also seems to tie into the concept of the magician or priest as generally outside their home society to some extent.
(The danger there seems to be thinking you’ve experienced enough to know for sure that a particular rule is just dumb human/social/whatever custom, and that you are Above These Things–that leads to all sorts of badness, from the guys who think they don’t have to shower to get girls to the people who think “hey, don’t randomly murder folks” doesn’t apply to them. “Travelling atoms still have to abide by the rules of the larger cosmos” might be the applicable metaphor here.)

Hi JMG,
We have only made it to page 81 and what a long, strange trip it has already been. My experience has been that it takes approximately a month to come to any kind of grips with the assigned reading, and I certainly would not have made it this far without your commentary so thank you very much. For me at least, the pace you are setting is about right.
One question that has been nagging at me is what exactly is Fortune’s definition of Logos? It is one of those terms that has a lot of potential meanings, depending on the context. The one I am most familiar with is that Logos is the Word of God. She seems to equate the Logos with a Great Entity, so maybe the Word of God is close in this case.

Up to Chapter 13 of CosDoc (I have the Millennium edition), I felt that I was ‘getting it’ through a combination of my own reading and meditations, and your first-class commentary, JMG. However, like both Cat and Phutatorius, I find this chapter to be really tough going. To be honest, I find it almost impenetrable. 
The first page is clear enough, but then it gets into “tracks in space… [that] are mutually cancelling”; a “central point of unmanifestation”; tracks in space that are “the nature of a closed figure”; “Logoidal Phases” and “Logoidal ideas”; a “huge replica of the Great Entity”; “miniature reflections of the Logos”; “Logoidal vibrations” and “Logoidal rhythms”; the “Logoidal Mind”; “circular rhythms” that “sets up a vortex”… I suddenly feel like Dorothy when she first arrived in Oz! And, to be honest, I found your commentary only marginally helpful. 
It looks like I have hit a brick wall that can only be opened if I have (or create) a Rosetta Stone, or have been given a rope that as 1,843 knots in it (which, of course, must be untied). Perhaps the sheer profusion of images requires that (for a change) I re-read each paragraph umpteen times and meditate on each of these images in isolation of each other. I know the chapter is about the creation of the Mind but 90% of the images are going right over my head. Right now, I feel like I can handle the Nursery Rhyme “Row, row, row your boat” (which I find to be the deepest Nursery Rhyme in the English language) but not much more complex than that! Rather humbling…

This morning I’m noticing that the “back-to-front” nature of a universe compared to a cosmos includes the fact that the Unmanifest that “wells up” is at its centre, not at its outer boundary.  The welling up Unmanifest in this case is arising from “Logoidal consciousness” – ie, it is thinking, imagining,  playing and these previously unmanifested  phenomena are made available to complex atoms arriving at the centre to help “real-ise”.  
And I suppose the word “reflection” is the key to why it is all back to front – there is something of a mirror quality involved.







 Johnny says: 



								June 14, 2019 at 5:59 am							




Hi Scotlyn,
I found that even though there is much of this book (so far!) that I do not understand properly, the image it’s helped me form, this metaphor, gets clearer slowly and more intricate.  So there is a part of it that I am struggling with and don’t know how to use, and then a part of it that makes sense.  What I find compelling about it is that the parts I feel I understand are quite useful and it does feel like when I try to  hold my ideas or observations about the world up to it they find a home in this framework, I think as a result it’s slowly becoming a a kind of default tool for my thinking, even though my grasp of it is clumsy.  I feel like this is the goal, it feels in line with her concept of things, I know I will use maybe the wrong terms here, but I feel like there is a move to get under things, to try to find a simpler, greater movement within or underneath what presents itself.  So she doesn’t fight with your specific observations, she doesn’t claim truth and so you can’t even dispute it on that level, she tries to get under that process, to give you a metaphor to house everything in.
I felt I had like you a feeling of “getting it” again with these last couple chapters, at least a bit,
My recent breakthroughs are to do with how external forces do not move Great Entities (I think this is the term she uses at this part – I don’t have my book here and I am far from an expert), they are guided by inner states.  This, I think shows how the movement of an idea can transfer from the mind of one person to others, if they find it is manifested before them and represents something that their inner feelings find appealing. Then they align with that movement.
Also how movement requires direction, and how attempting to move in multiple directions simultaneously is impossible or at least counterproductive – this is one of the ways that limitation is a powerful tool.  I also suspect that the 12 and 7 connect to the idea of time (12 hours a day, 7 days a week, 12 months of the year)  maybe I’m wrong, but repeated movement over time.
I’m not sure I’ve explained myself well but something in your first post felt quite familiar so I thought I’d write.
Thanks,
Johnny

Part of Stefania’s extensive meditation perhaps brings us to the utility of one of  the essential precepts of Stoicism:  the importance and utility of  distancing oneself, if only a little,  from the crude  impacts of physical and emotional ‘reality’, so that one can advance to a widened range of experience and perception – the truly human. 
This is also expressed in the Sufi saying: ‘Are you merely  a polo ball, to be driven this way and that by the impact of the mallet?’
In the Ancient world, the Stoics were criticised for not over-emoting over life’s little (inevitable) incidents, such illness, death, loss of fortune, injustice, illness.
But they would have replied that to spend one’s life in mere knee-jerk reaction to what is inevitably a part of human existence on this plane, is in one sense not to have lived fully at all. -compared to what is possible to those who try….

If what starts as movement–spirit, mind, etc.–becomes manifest in a body as it evolves, what is happening in cos doc terms when a human achieves gwynfydd and no longer incarnates in a physical body, yet evolves to continually higher states? It seems that it has finished a trip in one direction, and begun to go in another. I’m reminded of the Inferno, in which man goes through hell, turns on the devil’s midsection, up is down and down is up, and then proceeds to heaven. How would Dion Fortune state the change in direction as one enters gwynfydd?

I would like to briefly summarize my understanding of this chapter on “The Beginning of Mind” to make sure that I correctly understand how the terms mind, atom, and object are being used. The concept that mind is a “pure movement in space” makes perfect sense. What tends to confuse me is that the terms atom and object immediately make me think of something that is material. Yet I believe that in this chapter we are not yet really talking about the material plane when discussing how each of our minds came into being. 
So in the beginning, I was a traveling atom that was not yet material. As this atom, I traveled the seven planes of the universe and eventually settled down for a time near the central point where the “Unmanifest wells up.” The tracks I laid while traveling were the beginning of my mind. These tracts then (my mind), because they are near the central point of the universe, harmonize with the Logoidal mind creating a universe in miniature. 
Then eventually, my mind¬–atom will begin to contemplate its experiences and project a thought form that will become my physical body. So I am a composite of the pure movements that I have created in my evolution (my mind), the non-material atom that created those movements, and finally the physical body that resulted from the thought form created by my mind–atom contemplating its experiences.
This is interesting because the Cosmos started with pure movement that then created atoms, where I started as an atom of our universe that created pure movement that then became my mind. Thus my mind is a reflection of the Cosmos/Logos. Thanks everyone and that is where my mind is tracking right now as it contemplates the Cosmic Doctrine.

Scotlyn, JMG:
JMG wrote: “One important implication is that what spirit is, mind, consciousness today, if it sustains itself over time, becomes matter, substance, manifestation tomorrow.”
And Scotlyn wrote: “And this is precisely because manifestation is a sort of density of movements ‘in the abstract’ which when less dense are still more diffuse consciousness.  And that density comes from repetition and rhythm, deepening particular tracks in space until they are dense enough to be ‘held constant’ and manifest.”
What I’ve noticed in my own magical practice is a certain amount of what I have been thinking of as ‘backsliding,’ although that may be a bit too ungentle of a term.  For example, I’ll identify a specific imbalance in my consciousness, try to deal with it using magic, and then celebrate figuring it’s gone for good.  Then a short time later I’ll notice the same imbalance popping up again, just like a cat with nine lives that keeps on coming back.  It has been quite frustrating at times!  I’ll go through a phase where I’ll notice the imbalance popping up, at least be able to recognize that it’s an imbalanced way of going about things, but not be able to do much to balance it out.  I think my geomantic oracles have also noticed this because there have been times when I could almost see them doing the spiritual equivalent of a facepalm in response to my questioning, or hear them asking in frustration, ‘Have you not figured that out yet?!?’ I too would be getting sick and tired of the imbalance in question, but would be held under its power for a time longer, carry on swinging from one extreme thought or emotion to the other, and would have to resort to apologizing to the oracles for being possibly the worst mage ever 🙂
In light of the Cos Doc and your comments, I can start to reframe this.  So my old patterns of thinking are etched into my consciousness like tracks in space, and my thinking can almost not help but fall into those tracks, like how bike tires can almost not avoid falling into streetcar tracks (if you’ve ever ridden a bike in downtown Toronto, you might know about this).  Through magic I’ve been trying to get my consciousness to move over into new, better functioning tracks in space, which originate from the Logos.  For a while I stay in the new tracks, but then I inevitably get drawn back to the old, more familiar, more established tracks.  So hopefully, through enough repetition in magic and exposure of my consciousness to the Logoidal tracks, they’ll eventually become better established, and the ‘backsliding’ will be decreased.
From the Cos Doc: “Then you have this condition: an atom…which is too complex to settle down upon a plane of manifestation, returns to the Centre, having developed by its movement a circuit of pure motion which is of a Cosmic type of manifestation. Its Cosmic aspect is stamped with the Logoidal image, tuned to the Logoidal rhythm by the process described, and this abstract aspect of the atom…causes its concrete aspect to move with a circular rhythm…and this circular rhythm, being thus held constant, as distinguished from the tangential movements of the atoms of the planes, sets up a vortex, and the atoms about it are drawn into that vortex.”
The above passage almost makes it sound like the atoms can permanently establish a new track in space that is held constant.  Although at any rate, ‘just keep doing your practices’ still seems like sound advice to me.

Shivadas, excellent. As we used to say back in the day, ’tis an ill wind that blows no minds! 
Kimberly, yep. That’s the terrifying thing about freedom, as Sartre used to point out: you get to make your bed however you want, but then you get to lie in it…
Cliff, the thing about repetitive behavior is that you need to watch what the results are. If you’re good with them, great; if not, why, you need to change. As for the awakening of the Cosmic atom, that’s way further along than what the Druid material is talking about. Druidry tends to be fairly pragmatic, and so focuses on the changes we can move toward in this or immediately subsequent lives; the Cos.Doc. is tracing out things on a gargantuan scale, in which the movement from Abred to Gwynfydd is only one modest step in the immensity of our spiritual journey. 
Ganesh, excellent! The thing is, the Cos.Doc. can be studied with advantage over and over again for many years. Western cultures have nearly forgotten how to work with a text in that way, revisiting it again and again, going deeper with each pass — I know some people who still remember how to do that with the Bible, but even there it’s not common. The kind of sustained attention that Hindu pandits give to the Vedas is something we’re going to have to relearn in the centuries ahead. Yes, the Cos.Doc. is a good place to start. 
Scotlyn, I wonder if this is one of the places where a spectrum has been replaced by its two extremes, with dead and fossilized ritual and no ritual at all as the only two options seen as available. Ritual is a creative art, a performance art in which the practitioner and the audience are the same person, and practicing a ritual like the SoP is just like practicing a piece of music — you can ring a lot of changes within the established framework!

Chris, yes, yes, and of course it could be written with any number of other metaphors. Fortune chose the metaphors of space because a lot of people find those evocative; you can find different metaphors in other occult texts from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
SLClaire, delighted to hear it. 
Booklover, that’s certainly one of the things I like about it. 
Onething, not at all. Matter isn’t lower or lesser than spirit, it’s simply spirit that’s taken on a stable form for a time, for the sake of making certain kinds of experience possible. 
Chris, and that’s certainly one source of potential metaphors! 
Isabel, nicely put. Exactly — the traveling atoms aren’t free in the sense of completely random or self-directed, they’re free in the sense that they’re not locked into an orbit around the Logos, and so can enter the presence of the Logos and become able to relate to it in a richer and more interesting manner. 
Samurai_47, Fortune is being evasive. In the traditions of Rosicrucian mysticism, the Christ, the Logos or second person of the Trinity, dwells in the sun — the Biblical reference is from Psalm 18, “He hath set up his tabernacle in the sun.” By talking about the Solar Logos she’s able to nod and wink to Christian students without upsetting those who have a well-developed Jesus allergy. You can approach the Cos.Doc. from a Christian or a non-Christian standpoint — the metaphors work either way. 
Ron, yeah, this is a tough one. Take it a little at a time. 
Scotlyn, nicely done. 
Dashui, fascinating. Thank you. 
Xabier, excellent! Yes, exactly. 
Kyle, it’s not actually a change in direction, but something a little different. In Abred, the soul is contained in and limited by a body. In Gwynfydd, the body is contained in and transformed by a soul. The dwellers in Gwynfydd have bodies, but the bodies are imperishable and responsive to the will in a way that our current bodies are not. 
Dan, excellent! Yes, exactly. 
Stefania, yes, exactly. The tracks in space laid down by previous thoughts and actions can take quite a bit of time, effort, and understanding to overcome. The more often you can deliberately do things the way you want to do them, rather than the habitual way, the sooner you can make that happen — but it’s not fast no matter what.

What caught my attention in this chapter, and the point to which I return again and again is about a quarter of the way in: 
Traveling atoms, having gone out to the outermost plane, return from it, not to a Central Stillness, but to a central point where the Unmanifest “wells up” and becomes manifest.   It is with that phase of the development of manifestation,  wherein new aspects of the Logoidal consciousness are being realized, that these traveling atoms find their nearest affinity.
Logoidal images have to pass from a Cosmic state (that is unmanifest when viewed from the standpoint of a universe) to a manifest condition, and in that transition they pass through a phase which is identical with that state of existence of the tracks in space drawn by the movement of an object. Therefore, being of the same nature, they can influence the tracks in space thus drawn. 
Seems to me we have some parties to this discussion that are very familiar with this process! For me, it connects to processes of artistic inspiration, what might be referred to as the Muse. And also, the processes of manifesting what was formerly unmanifest. 
DF refers to “great numbers of travelling atoms returning to the creative center and being  bathed in the influences of the Logoidal ideas”. 
Daily I awaken from dreams that seem to take me to such a place, and I find I don’t have the conceptual equipment to bring what I find there over to waking life.
Any comment?

Hi John Michael,
Thanks for the confirmation of my suspicions about the metaphor. This topic is something that I have not read about – directly – before and so it is nice to understand that it is not a case of ‘one size fits all’. Such a circumstance would make for a rather dull world. And who wants that? 😉 The world is far more fascinating than most people may consider it to be.
Cheers

Explain who and what the Central Sun is, particularly in relation to the “sun” in its physical aspects that we can see up in the sky, and its spiritual “Logoic” aspects, or is it an entity or being? These are very esoteric uses of ordinary ideas which is why I suppose it is esoteric, haha. If there is a Solar Logos there is an earthly/planet Logos. I don’t recall reading this before. It’s opaque.

Just a thought: We in the West are educated, that the material is fundamental and from there everything evolves, like consciousness is an emergent property of the brain.
However the more I think about it, I am considering that consciousness (tracks in space) is fundamental and everything else emerges from there.
So in my mind where Fortune wants to guide us, is to change our perspective:
From material being fundamental to consciousness being fundamental.
Nice summer evening to meditate here…
Thanks for the guidance, John!

Another thought: Isn’t E=m*c square  pointing in the exactly same direction?
Here energy is fundamental and matter is evolving from that.
Somehow that formula for me also shows the point that Fortune want to point us to:
The material world is not so solid as it seems for us and matter is not fundamental.

Hi JMG,
I’m starting to work with Chapter 5 now. I’d like to have your comments about some things that occurred with me in my first meditation on that chapter which I did not find discussed in the comments on Chapter 5.
I started envisioning the primal atom as Fortune describes it: two tangential movements circulating about each other, with a core of motionless vacuum. Then it occurred to me: motionless vacuum is what is outside the Ring-Pass-Not. If the motionless vacuum within the primal atom can be equated with the motionless vacuum outside the RPN, then an atom is sort of like a Cosmos turned inside-out. And if that’s the case, little cosmoi could form inside the atom from the same process that formed the Cosmos of which the atom is part. As above, so below, and all that.
Then I realized that I’ve imagined Fortune’s atoms as like a chemist’s atoms: teeny-tiny, way tinier than me. But she never says or implies this. The Cosmos is so unimaginably huge that even an atom that is teeny-tiny on the scale of the Cosmos could be vastly huge at my scale, bigger than our galaxy, for instance. That made sense of my thinking about an atom that could hold cosmoi within it. Imagine such an atom then going through all the unimaginably complex process of evolution she describes! 
Anyway, I wanted to ask if I’m on the right track in imagining that there might be a correspondence between the space inside an atom and the space outside the RPN and if it then made sense to imagine cosmoi forming inside the atom.
Another thing that this brings up: the atoms I learned about in chemistry class, and in fact all the scientific metaphors we use, can be described in just the same way as Fortune’s metaphors: they are meant to train the mind, not inform it. The two systems train the mind to different metaphors that then allow the minds so trained to do different things. Neither of them is any more “real” than the other; both are useful to those who know which one to use when.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Evolution of the Divine Sparks 
July 10, 2019July 13, 2019John Michael Greer40 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your seat belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 13, “The Evolution of the Divine Sparks,” pp. 59-64.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 14, “The Seed Atom Building a Seventh Plane Body,” pp. 82-89.
Commentary:
In the last several chapters, Fortune has discussed the emergence of the raw materials of a solar system and their organization into a swarm of individual beings, each of them composed of three parts: a seed-atom that began as one of the traveling atoms of the solar system, a shell of seventh-plane atoms that gather around the seed-atom and form the first and simplest kind of body, and a set of tracks in space marked out by the rhythms of the Solar Logos, which form the first and simplest kind of mind.
There are also vast numbers of atoms not yet organized into individual beings, circling the Solar Logos like clouds of dust around a newborn sun. That’s the image Fortune wants you to think of. because her grand metaphor draws extensively on the astrophysics of her time. If you keep in mind accounts of the solar system’s origin from popular scientific literature, you’ll have an easier time following along with the material in this chapter.
The individual beings, though, are the ones who matter just now. The seed-atom and its shell of seventh-plane atoms go through their various changes and gradually settle down into a stable rhythm. The tracks in space are another matter. From here on, Fortune calls these the Divine Sparks, as they are reflections of the Solar Logos’ own consciousness—in terms of the metaphor, patterns of movement that echo the movements of the Logos. The Divine Sparks don’t settle down to a stable rhythm, because they’re constantly being influenced by three sets of movements from outside themselves. First, each Divine Spark is pulled this way and that by the movements of the seed-atom to which it is connected; second, each Divine Spark is jostled by all the other Divine Sparks in its swarm; third, each Divine Spark is constantly influenced by the Solar Logos itself.
So the Divine Sparks remain nimble and capable of learning, and what starts out as a random jostling of one Divine Spark by another gradually settles into something far more complex: a reflection of the Solar Logos made up of all the individual beings that have come into existence, held in balance by their Divine Sparks. Think of it as a spherical mass of atoms—a planet—orbiting the Solar Logos in the seventh plane. As the Divine Sparks and their atoms interact, they establish a rhythm and form a set of tracks in space, which—since movement is consciousness—becomes the collective consciousness of the newborn planet.
Dion Fortune engages in another bit of trickery here, and those readers who know their way around geometry, sacred or otherwise, will doubtless have caught it already. The symbol of the Solar Logos is a sphere, she notes, and the number of primary manifestation is three; therefore the symbol of the first satellite is a three-sided pyramid in a sphere. She might as well have said a three-sided pentagram or a three-sided sphere, since there are of course no three-sided pyramids; the pyramidal figure with the smallest number of sides is a tetrahedron, which has four sides. (Did you forget to count the bottom?)
Again, as long as you remember that all this is metaphor, you’re fine. For practical purposes, the symbol of the first satellite is a circle surrounding a triangle; just keep in mind that the circle represents a sphere, and the triangle represents a threefold pattern in space. There’s a hint here for those who are ready to take it, since the triangle, the number three, and all other ternary symbols are traditionally linked to the planet Saturn, the Lord of Form, and in the Rosicrucian philosophy that forms the usually unstated basis for the Cosmic Doctrine, the first great cycle of the creative process, and the first of the seven globes in each cycle, corresponds in a symbolic sense to Saturn.
So we have the first satellite orbiting the Solar Logos. The Solar Logos is aware of it, and each of the Divine Sparks is aware, in a much more limited degree, of the Solar Logos. The collective consciousness of the planet—the Planetary Spirit, as Fortune will call it in the next chapter*—is not aware of the Solar Logos, but it is aware that the Divine Sparks are aware of something that it cannot perceive itself. It knows itself and the conditions of its existence, and it knows the atoms whose motions in space have brought it into being; as the Divine Sparks are influenced by the Solar Logos and change accordingly, it learns indirectly of the Solar Logos that conditions them.
(*Fortune had trouble making up her mind about what to call this entity. In the first published version, and thus in the Millennium Edition, it was the Planetary Spirit; in the revised version, it was the Planetary Being. I prefer Planetary Spirit, as this is the term used in other occult literature, and so that’s the label we’ll be using here.)
As the consciousness of the Divine Sparks becomes more and more coordinated, the Planetary Spirit gets a clearer and clearer understanding of the Logos as reflected through the minds of the Sparks, and so it achieves an awareness of the Solar Logos. Meanwhile, the Solar Logos has something new to think about; the experiences of the atoms and Divine Sparks on the first satellite are new to the Logos, and it turns inward, contemplating these, until it has absorbed those experiences and integrated them into its understanding of things. While that happens, the Divine Sparks keep doing what they were doing, and the Planetary Spirit keeps doing what it was doing, and the resulting repeated movements build up tracks in space that form an enduring template for the first satellite.
Then the Solar Logos finishes its contemplations and turns its attention back to the solar system. Its dance has changed, the dances of the Divine Sparks change accordingly, the pattern of balanced stresses that holds the first satellite together breaks up, and so does the first satellite. All the individuals that composed it go spinning away into the great dust cloud of atomic matter that surrounds the Solar Logos, and a cycle of involution comes to its end.
Two things happen thereafter, though. The first is that the individual beings, having absorbed the possibility of integrating themselves as a planet, do the same thing again. Since they’ve worked through all the possibilities of their seventh plane bodies, they have enough (metaphoric) mass to attract atoms of the sixth plane, and so they add a shell of sixth plane atoms to the seventh plane body they already have. They proceed to form a new satellite on the sixth plane, and work through all the changes there that they worked through on the seventh, gradually evolving a collective consciousness that becomes a new Planetary Spirit.
At the same time, the Planetary Spirit of the first satellite didn’t go anywhere; it remains, an intricate pattern of tracks in space just waiting for atoms to fill it. There are plenty of seventh plane atoms drifting around aimlessly, and over time enough of them get drawn into the tracks in space of the Planetary Spirit that a new planet is born.
These atoms, though, have a conditioning influence the first swarm of traveling atoms didn’t have. The Planetary Spirit absorbed all the influences of the traveling atoms, was conscious of their consciousness, and gradually reached the point at which it could contemplate the Solar Logos as it was reflected in the Divine Sparks. Its rhythmic dance thus includes all the capacities of the first swarm of seed-atoms, including their ability to gather a seventh-plane body and the pattern of tracks in space that linked them to the Solar Logos. The atoms gathered by the Planetary Spirit accordingly pick up all these capacities, and become individual beings with Divine Sparks and seventh-plane bodies. Thus the traveling atoms of the first swarm are the makers of the Planetary Spirit, but the Planetary Spirit is the mother of each of the subsequent swarms.
The whole process then repeats. The Divine Sparks of the first swarm, on the new planet of the sixth plane, integrate themselves to the point that the new Planetary Spirit can experience the Solar Logos through them; the Divine Sparks of the second swarm go through their own changes on the first planet under the guidance of its Planetary Spirit; the Solar Logos retreats into contemplation, absorbing all the new experiences of the atoms of the first two swarms; then it turns its attention outward again, and the two planets dissolve.
The first swarm then moves out to the fifth plane, and begins building a new planet there.  The second swarm moves to the sixth plane, becomes part of a planet there, and gets to work building its own sixth plane bodies under the guidance of the second Planetary Spirit.  Meanwhile, another batch of seventh plane atoms gets swept up into the embrace of the first Planetary Spirit, which teaches them to build seventh plane bodies and endows them with Divine Sparks.
The process continues, until there are seven planets revolving around the Solar Logos, each one with its own Planetary Spirit, each one inhabited by individual beings who have a number of bodies appropriate to the plane they have reached. The process doesn’t end there, but what happens when all seven planets are in existence will be the subject of a later chapter.
(It’s probably worth putting in a caution here, because many readers who reach this chapter jump to the conclusion that since the Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system, it must be the third planet to be created in the process we’re discussing, and thus exists on the fifth plane. Not so; as will be explained later on, the Earth, being a planet of physical matter, exists on the first or material plane, like all the other planets we see with telescopes. How does that work? Ahem. “These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are designed to train the mind, not to inform it.” The easiest way to misunderstand the Cos.Doc. is to take it too literally.)
Something else has been going on all this time, though, while the swarms have been taking shape and proceeding down the planets. Remember that the Solar Logos is aware of the Divine Sparks, just as they are (in a much more limited way) aware of the Logos. Every time a swarm of individual beings finishes its evolution on a planet, and the Solar Logos turns inward to contemplate the new experiences of that evolution, it integrates all those experiences into its consciousness—in the metaphor, it expresses them in the motions of its dance. As each swarm of atoms in the first planet acquires a Divine Spark, that Divine Spark moves in harmony with the dance of the Solar Logos at the time when it is formed.
As a result, each swarm of individual beings comes into existence on the seventh plane with all the lessons of its predecessors embodied in abstract form in its Divine Spark. The first swarm, composed of the traveling atoms of the solar system, does the heaviest of the heavy lifting in creating the planets; each of the next two swarms, as we’ll see, also has a particular task to take care of in the genesis of the solar system. The beings of these three swarms have names in each of the religious traditions Dion Fortune drew on in shaping her great metaphor. In the language of Jewish Cabala and Christian theology; they are identified with the hierarchies of the angels; in the language of traditional Pagan religion, they are called gods and goddesses. In the Rosicrucian philosophy that underlies the Cosmic Doctrine, they are called the Lords of Flame, the Lords of Form, and the Lords of Mind. We’ll be discussing them in much more detail in chapters to come.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on August 14.  Until then, have at it!

John–
I’m still working my way through the Theosophical literature (Ocean of Theosophy and The Divine Plan to start with–I haven’t even gotten to The Secret Doctrine yet), but the structure here seems reflective of the seven rounds and seven globes discussed by Judge and Barborka.  I suppose this is not unexpected, given your discussion of DF’s theosophical background.

Thank You for this.

David BTL, that sevenfold structure was standard all through late 19th and 20th century occultism, so you’re quite right — it’s not unexpected! Fortune had her original training in Theosophy — her Golden Dawn days were later — and her teacher Thomas Moriarty was very strongly influenced by Rosicrucian literature from America, especially The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians by “Magus Incognito” and the writings of Max Heindel, all of which had a lot of secondhand Theosophy in it. As for Judge and Barborka, everyone read Judge, and Barborka’s The Divine Plan is the book that Theosophists in Seattle were recommending as an introduction back when I lived there, so they’re pretty much in the mainstream of the tradition. 
Whispers, you’re most welcome.

In the first paragraph you lay out the 3 components of the individual beings, but a bit later you refer to the divine spark. What is the divine spark? Is it the same as the seed atom?

After reading the most recent Magic Monday questions and answers, it was quite interesting to reach the end of the chapter and find Fortune saying “This is what is meant by involution.”  It is also interesting to see how the turning of the ring cosmos and how it brings change by its revolutions is echoed in the periods of inward contemplation followed by new outward attention of the solar logos. 
Two other thoughts struck me on this first read through of the chapter.  The first is how much further away from the origin of the cosmos each new entity or set of entities is, or looking another way, how when we contemplate or attempt to connect with other beings (say, the archangels in the cabala), how it brings us closer and closer as we trace our way back to the unmanifest, and that “first movement in space” (which I am still using as a meditation seed from time to time).  The other thought balancing that, though, is even these divine sparks and the solar logos are seeing the unmanifest through a remove, and through their own particular experiences through the planes and their own contemplation and understanding. Each is a new manifestation of the original potential, and their own experiences and contemplation influence those that came before and those that will come after.
Like the solar logos, we can contemplate these new ideas and then incorporate them as we re-engage with the world.  We ourselves influence those already here as well as those who will come after us, while acknowledging those who have come before us and therefore prepared the way for us to understand this in our own limited way.

Circumambulation has taken on a new meaning for me over the past few weeks. I have been contemplating the movement as creating a consciousness around a ritual and then dissolving it or sending it off somewhere by moving in the opposite direction after the work is complete. Now I am going to have a difficult time not envisioning multiple dimensions with little angels moving back and forth now and then to help out their little brothers. My concern at this point is not as much about taking the metaphor literally as much as modifying it into my own less helpful version. So many questions come to mind that I really want to skip ahead, but moving  too fast would probably mean less of it would stick.

Onething, no, as noted in the first few paragraphs, the tracks in space that form the first and simplest form of mind are what Fortune calls the Divine Sparks. “The tracks in space are another matter. From here on, Fortune calls these the Divine Sparks, as they are reflections of the Solar Logos’ own consciousness…”
Cat, excellent. Exactly.
Aloysius, just wait until we get a little further!

“Ten is the Number of forces in manifestation for our universe…”
When the number ten pops up in an esoteric context, the Tree of Life comes to mind.  In Dion’s metaphor, if I understand it correctly, the Tree of Life seems to have been expressed as a series of nested spheres, or concentric circles.  I’m sure I’ve seen somewhere a diagram of the Tree that looks like that, rather than the traditional more familiar shape with three pillars.  Since each successive plane is symbolized by a figure of increasing facets, then each plane or sphere takes on an additional layer of complexity.  It incorporates the ideas, rules or laws (archetypes – original forms or models) of all the planes above it, plus one more.  At the very center of the nested spheres we would find Malkuth, the last of the Sephirah, the material world of the senses.  Malkuth is the most complex, the end result of all the work or involution on the previous planes. So Malkuth is contained within Kether, and all the rest of the Sephiroth.  An implication of this is that the material world is not somehow separate or set apart from the spiritual worlds but is in fact contained within it and derived from it.  For us – we are not only material beings as we appear to the senses but are contained within a larger spiritual reality.

Well now I see why JMG said over on Dreamwidth that Meher Baba sounds Rosicrucian! p.s. I was the one whom sent in the various quotes but forgot to log back into Dreamwidth so that post shows up as Anonymous.
I now think everyone participating in the Cosmic Doctrine posts would very much enjoy Meher Baba’s God Speaks. Fortune lived from 1890 to 1946. Baba lived from 1894 to 1969. So I’m not surprised God Speaks sounds like a more dense, companion volume to The Cosmic Doctrine. There are differences between them of course but many similarities as well. The only difference I would mention is that since Baba’s students were primarily Hindus and Muslims so he uses terms familiar to those two groups but would most likely be unknown to most of JMGs readers. All terms used in the book are defined in the glossary in the back.
BTW, I found a site that shows ALL of the various (some huge) fold-out charts and graphics that are plastered throughout Baba’s God Speaks
Check out this: http://www.meherbabalibrary.com/babalist/list_v/list-v-session-notes-4g15.html
Somebody took the time to scan and upload all of them to the web. I’m still busy reading the book and it’s very dense. Believe me…those fold-out charts and fold-out graphics are a huge help in trying to come to terms with what Baba is teaching. In fact, the final fold-out is actually a huge removable *poster* sitting in a pocket glued to the inside back cover with a separate booklet in it as well on the history of the making of God Speaks. It’s in the above weblink if you scroll down. It’s the one titled
Mystic, Sufi and Vedantic Terms Related to the Planes of Consciousness as Used in God Speaks and it takes 5 scans to get the entire poster onto that webpage (not to mention all the other charts and graphics taken from the book).
A lot of Fortune’s Cosmic Doctrine sounds like it’s right at home with what Baba is talking about although she goes into the subject in a (to me) far more accessible way.
I for one will be eagerly awaiting JMG’s published companion book to Fortune’s Cosmic Doctrine and  it’ll sit on my home library shelf next to God Speaks.

Stefania, got it in one! Yes, exactly — the Tree of Life diagram with the ten circles in three pillars is only one way of conceptualizing the relation between the ten principles. Fortune is using another: the Solar Logos, which is threefold (like the Cosmos, it’s built along the plan of the Three Rings), and the seven planes, each with its planet. 
Happypandatao, that’s fascinating — thank you for this. Yes, those charts seem very familiar; it’s clear that spiritual teachers from the late 19th through the mid-20th century had a common vision that guided their work. You might be interested in comparing some of Meher Baba’s concepts to the Rosicrucian teachings in Rosicrucian Fundamentals by George Winslow Plummer or The Secret Doctrines of the Rosicrucians by the pseudonymous “Magus Incognito”; you can download the first of those as a free PDF here and the second is available online here.

I suspect this has already been said, but I’ll say it anyway: Put into the context of Christianity, the seed-atom is God the Father, the shell is God the Son, and the tracks in space are the Holy Spirit.  The Logos is the Word of God.  God has seven archangels that relate to days of the week: Michael (Sunday), Gabriel (Monday), Raphael (Tuesday), Uriel (Wednesday), Selaphiel (Thursday), Raguel or Jegudiel (Friday), and Barachiel (Saturday).

JMG
Talking of tradition, I turned last night to Vaughan Hart’s ‘Art & Magic in the Court of the Stuarts’. An Inigo Jones’ drawing for a West Front of St Paul’s, London is represented within a circle containing an equilateral triangle. This and other examples are discussed within the hermetic tradition; citing Roy Strong and Rene Taylor, and discussion extends to (differing) versions of the design, including Philip II’s  earlier Escorial monastery/palace in Spain and to traditions of Solomon’s Temple. (As I understand it Philip wanted to flag himself up as a latter-day King Solomon.) Which all, as I understand it, ties in with Masonic traditions.

A fascinating post as always John.  I’m only lightly following the analysis as I don’t want to confuse matters with my progress on the OBOD course.  It does occur to me, especially after reading Happypandatao’s comment, that in addition to doing a companion to the Cosmic Doctrine, there could be merit in producing a new occult work that is based on similar theory but is presented in terms and metaphors that are more accessible to the modern mind.  Having said that, it’s possible that exactly what you have in mind with underlying purpose this blog!

This book is so out there. If it weren’t for some clarity provided from these posts, I’d definitely have stopped reading. I’m still thoroughly confused. I thought us earth dwellers were hanging out in a solar system on the seventh plane within this framework of rings, planes, and rays that all began with pure movement in space. Now on that seventh plane, after some give and take between divine sparks, or tracks in space, there’s a satellite that corresponds to Saturn symbology, but the earth symbology is on the first plane. How did earth go from the seventh to the first? Or is that just the symbology and the seventh plane is reflected in the first?
I’m also confused how the divine spark is the track itself. I was envisioning these tracks being form by seed atoms and that, through repetitive experiences, those tracks deepened, forming deep grooves. If the grooves are the tracks, and the tracks are the divine sparks, how do those divine sparks/grooves interact to form this stable satellite? What’s so divine about a track?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								July 11, 2019 at 12:49 pm							




Kimberly, yep. Remember that Dion Fortune was a devout if eccentric Christian; her book Mystical Meditations on the Collects presents her vision of esoteric Christianity in the context of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, and her (still mostly unpublished) writings for the Guild of the Master Jesus, the specifically Christian end of her magical order, are very solidly based on Christian tradition and symbolism. 
Phil H, that’s a wonderful book! Yes, exactly; the roots of Freemasonry are all tangled up in that end of Renaissance occult thought, with the application of sacred geometry to architecture only one of the more obvious dimensions of that. 
Averagejoe, that’s a possibility I’ve been considering. It would be a helluva lot of work, but something of the sort needs to happen sooner or later. 
Mike, okay, first, it’s important to remember the difference between the Cosmic planes and the planes within a solar system. The traveling atom that became our Solar Logos settled down on the seventh Cosmic plane to create its solar system, and that solar system mirrors the Cosmos, so it also has seven planes — all of which are sub-planes of the seventh Cosmic plane. It’s like this:

As for the Divine Sparks, what makes them divine is that they’re being influenced all the time by the Solar Logos, who is the god of this solar system. Remember that everything is a track in space — all that exists, as Fortune says in the first chapter, is space and motion — but there’s a difference between those tracks that have settled down into fixed patterns and those that can still be shaped by outside forces; we call the fixed tracks “matter” and the still flexible tracks “mind.”

As I meditate through the Cos. Doc. (I’m finishing up with Chapter 7 now, so it should be at least a few months before I catch up to you), I keep coming back to the metaphor of movement in space, and to the idea of metaphor itself as training the mind rather than informing it.
Regarding the former, in my continuing engagement with color breathing, within the past couple of weeks, as I have been re-reading Grade 2 of the DA, I have realized I made things harder than they had to be by the metaphor of the inside of my body that I chose. When I first started doing meditation in the AODA, I would imagine the inside of my body as having all its organs and such in it and that I was trying to push the color into it. Needless to say this did not work too well, but all the scientific training I’ve gone through had my mind pretty firmly trained into a metaphor of the human body that looked that way. After far too long of this, I then imagined the inside of my body as black and brought the color in a black space. Since I have specialized training in spectroscopy, black means no color so it should have been easier to bring the color in this way. Not really, as it turned out. It wasn’t till I re-read the lesson on color in Grade 2 that I remembered that in the DA metaphorical cosmos, black is a color too. *faceplant* Then the metaphor of space moving from the Cos. Doc. suggested envisioning the inside of myself as space, with the color outside as colored space, and breathing that colored space inside and out. Now that I can do! In other words, which metaphor I used determined what I could do with color breathing.
In my last comment on the preceding Cos. Doc. post, I mentioned that modern science is just another metaphor: it trains our minds rather than informing them. If we didn’t think it was actually informing us, meaning we think it’s “true,” we’d probably be in less trouble than we are. When I train my mind to use the scientific metaphor, I can do certain things – but not everything. Using Fortune’s metaphors to train my mind, I can do certain things that I can’t do by science, and vice versa. Both train my mind – to different ends. Which metaphor is most helpful depends on what I am trying to accomplish, just as it does with color breathing.

So in this framework, if I pray to, say, Aphrodite, am I interacting with the consciousness that’s made it all the way out to the first plane? Or am I interacting with the memory of that consciousness that’s stored within the Planetary Spirit? Or is something else going on that I have no concept of yet?

To further help participants whom have been following The Cosmic Doctrine posts may I add some further commentary from some of my other teachers.
One of those teachers is Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev. He said that as time and space curve inward everything moves toward the non-physical. This is where Science’s understanding breaks down because all instruments we’ve used to study black holes and all logic used to understand them are only extensions of our 5 senses – 6 senses actually when you include Mind itself as the sense that governs the other 5. As things move toward the non-physical Logic itself breaks down. Science, he said, has come to a place where it now recognizes the logic-using mind is hitting limits in its ability to explain things but due to strong societal taboos in STEM fields against being “illogical” they have resorted to calling it “Fuzzy Logic”.  Sadhguru, “If something is fuzzy that means it’s no longer logical.”
Certain places, objects and highly-evolved spiritual people have a much stronger connection to higher, non-physical planes of bliss, wisdom and power. If you circumnabulate those places or objects or people you are *literally riding the curve of Space-Time into subtler planes*. Hence why so many different spiritual traditions around the world have their adherents circumnabulating say…Tibetan Buddhist Stuppas, or Muslims circumnabulating the Kaaba (the Cube) in Mecca, or as some Hindus do…circumnabulating highly spiritually evolved beings like the Buddha’s students would do with him. It has to do with Physics. 
On a similar subject Sadhguru mentioned the Linga (notice how a Linga looks oddly similar to things discussed in The Cosmic Doctrine?).
Western university professors have equated the Hindu linga with male genitalia but he say in Tantra that’s not what a linga means.
It’s actually about Physics. Specifically that *any* form when it *first* becomes on the physical plane is shaped like an oval. When it moves toward the grossest level of the first non-physical plane the *last* shape it takes on the physical plane is once again an oval. Our physical plane likes curves – that’s what Time *is*. We only have time, Sadhguru said, because everything in Creation is cyclical. If this whole universe moved in a straight line there would be no such thing as Time and no such thing as memory. Everything would be completely brand new every moment (including ourselves). And the only reason there is Space is because of Time. And Time is…because of cycles.
[Note: I include the following for Cosmic Doctrine readers but I leave it up to JMG for him to ok or not. I mention it because it discusses Time and human physical embodiment on the physical plane. If JMG deems it gone too far off-topic then I’ll resubmit it without the following.]
One of Sadhguru’s students asked about Kalabhairava. Kala is Sanskrit for Time. Side note: Whenever Sadhguru talks about Shiva I’ve learned he’s *always* talking about the ineffible. Over and over and over he keeps reminding his audience that the sanskrit word Shi-va literally translates into english as “that which is not”. He’s NOT talking about a deity. I repeat, he’s not talking about a deity. It’s in reference to a dimension that is so far beyond anything ordinary humans can possibly know that the only way mystics, saints and yogis have ever been able to talk about it is by saying it is “that which is NOT”.
Sadhguru replied: “Khalabhairava means The Dark One – the most fearsome form of Shiva (“that which is NOT”). Khalabhairava is a deadly form of Shiva. When he went into a destroying mode. Not of destroying this, destroying that. It’s about destroying Time. All physical realities exist within a span of time. If I destroy your Time – everything is over. Right now something in you is ticking – lub-dub-lub-dub. Everything is ticking. Suppose I fast forward everything. It’s all over. Most people don’t live in a great manner. But they at least want to die in a great manner. All these lousy people doing lousy things to each other. So Shiva took the form of a check. It’s called Bhairavi Yatna. That means when the moment of Death comes, for all that you have been, your whole many, multiple lifetimes plays out in a single moment with *great intensity* and whatever pleasures, sufferings and pains that need to happen to you will all happen right then. All of it will happen to you in a microsecond but with the kind of intensity which you can not hold. 
This is called Bhairavi Yatna. Yatna means ultimate suffering. It’s the kind of suffering you experience in Hell. He (that which is not) will make it happen to you here. When you have to do that kind of job you have to do it with the right kind of costume. So he dresses up terrifying. If he looked nice that would be evil. If you have to do something terrible to somebody while looking nice that would be very evil. So at least he looks right for the part. So that-which-is-not put on the right costume and became Khalabhairav to create Bhairavi Yatna for you. To create such phenomenal pain that you would not have imagined such suffering could be possible. But just for a moment – so that after that – nothing of the past remains in you. He is undoing all your software. All of it – he unravels in a moment. This happens at the moment of true death (ie. the kind of death you won’t come back from no matter what medical science attempts), you have no choice, you can’t run. But he makes it as brief as possible. Suffering has to end very quickly so he makes it super intense – only then will it end quickly. If he did the unraveling mildly the suffering would go on and on and on.

SLClaire, excellent! Yes, exactly; our brains are six inches long, the universe is trillions of light years across, and so the best we can do is choose metaphors that enable us to do things we want to do. 
Cliff, we’ll get to that in a few more chapters!
Happypandatao, fair enough. I think, though, that that’s a good amount of this material for this month; I want to make sure not to dilute the focus of this discussion too much.

The Seven Archangels seem to correlate (to me, anyway) to the Seven Deadly Sins.  The Ring Cosmos of each angel has an opposing force, a Ring Chaos, that I see as a sort of Christian qlippoth, or “evil” opposite shell.  Since the seven angels correspond to the seven days of the week, here are some of the things I have come up with to denote their “good” and “evil” characteristics.
Sunday: The Sun.  Good side: cheerfulness, determination, happiness.  Deadly Sin side: Pride.  Egomania and bombastic proselytizing.  
Monday: Gabriel.  The Moon.  Good side: meditation, assessment, tranquility.  Deadly Sin side: Envy.  Lunacy and vanity.  
Tuesday: Raphael. Mars. Good side: bravery, valor, virility.  Deadly Sin side: Wrath.  Aggression and recklessness.
Wednesday: Mercury. Good side: communication, swiftness, innovation.  Deadly Sin side: Sloth. Prosthetic self-handicapping with technology.  
Thursday: Jupiter.  Good side: generosity, joy, magnanimity.  Deadly Sin side: Greed.  Unlimited hunger and parsimony.
Friday: Venus.  Good side: romantic love, comfort, sweetness.  Deadly Sin side: Lust.  Sex and porn addiction, puerile obsessions. 
Saturday: Saturn.  Good side: limits, grace, acceptance.  Deadly Sin side: Gluttony.  Consumer culture and hoarding.

It is interesting to apply these concepts of satellite evolution to our own personal cycles of reincarnation. Each cycle of incarnation I have passed through has left behind an archetypal form that gets reborn each reincarnation (repopulated with swarms of atoms). These reborn archetypal forms of my past lives would contain the consciousness of all my cycles of reincarnation, since “The new evolving atoms thus start where the old ended.” 
Since it seems we have not reached the point in the book where matter is added to the satellites, I am not sure if there are separate versions of me that will materialize on each plane I have incarnated on, or are all the individual archetypal forms of each of my past incarnations contained within my being (maybe both are true)?
So if I, for example, am on my 4th cycle of incarnation, the person typing this could be only the reborn archetypal form of the 3rd incarnation living on the 5th plane. Thus, there would also exist two versions of me living on the 7th and 6th planes that feel what I feel, and a 4th plane version of me who’s past archetypal forms I am just following without being conscious of it. I may be too literal here, but it is fun to ponder how our many lives may be interacting in ways I have not thought of till given this new model of creation in the Cosmic Doctrine.

This is a comment and question concerning your commentary on last month’s chapter, that I’ve been thinking about since then.
You warned of the trap of thinking that atoms, and their tracks in space (making up e.g. minds and memories), are two different things. To avoid the trap:
“Movement and space, between them, are all there is. Thus the distinction between objects and tracks in space is more apparent than real. Objects are tracks in space that, through repetition, have settled down into a stable condition. The tracks in space that still look like pure movement apart from objects are those that haven’t yet gone through all their changes.”
No problem. Analogously, energy locked into repeating cycles, we call matter.
“One important implication is that what is spirit, mind, consciousness today, if it sustains itself over time, becomes matter, substance, manifestation tomorrow. We explored that same point earlier in a different context, when talking about the difference between the Individuality (the part of the self that endures from life to life) and the personality evolved in each life. The point applies more generally, though. Understand it in its fullness and you grasp the necessity of repetition and rhythm in operative occultism.”
All right. When a GM warns you of a trap, it usually means there’s another one right next to it. No one last month pushed back on this, probably sensing the trap and staying clear of it, but I’ve been trying to confront it. The push-back you might have been expecting would be something like this: no amount of repetition and rhythm in operative occultism, nor any human spirit, mind, or consciousness can, as far as we know, bring a single material atom into manifestation. (A lot of energy [in the material physics sense] can, in a particle accelerator or supernova, but that’s not the point; and of course the energy too must already exist.)
By the repetitive action of stacking one brick upon another, I can bring a wall into existence, but you know (and you teach more clearly than anyone) that those bricks and the substance within them come from already existing matter. The laws of Limits, Cause and Effect, and the Planes concur.
But, ah, planes… that’s talking, of course, about the material plane. Matter, substance, and manifestation on higher planes are a different story. Occult practice, making use of rhythm and repetition, becoming manifestation on the etheric, astral, mental, and higher planes—which then feeds back via our consciousness to affect our mental and possibly our material situations… that sounds like magic as DF and you define and practice it.
This is typically understood as a kind of mutually influential resonance between patterns in time and space on the material plane, whether natural ones or ones we create through our actions, and the substance or entities of those higher planes. But there’s another metaphor (this is all metaphor; it’s really all One, all movements in space as it were) that seems to fit just as well: patterns in time and space on the material plane are the substance and entities of those higher planes.
Does that make sense? Are my heartbeat and circadian rhythms and the Krebs cycles of chemical respiration in my cells, the planets’ orbits and tides and seasons and life cycles of living things, themselves matter on the etheric plane? Are our daily routines, the memories we accumulate, the stories we tell, themselves matter on the astral plane? Are the words and concepts we share, the models of the world we derive from experience, themselves matter on the mental plane? (This might seem limiting, “confining” the higher planes to coexist where there’s also material. But the vast variety of patterns we can perceive, from quantum fields to Mandelbrot fractals to the grain in stone to the intergalactic foam, points toward an infinity of other patterns beyond our perception or comprehension. And one can’t really make size comparisons between infinities.)
This seems to work for me as an approach to visualizing, even if it’s just one of many. But is there some trap there?

So by the time we show up on the 7th plane, there have been at least six rounds of divine sparks before us, the first three of which are gods who have gone on to form the rest of the six “planets”, since they’re all already in existence when we arrive? If so, are those other three groups after the gods and before us entities that have evolved past simple material bodies, maybe not having mental bodies on gwynfydd or something similar?
I also notice that the original group of gods is first only indirectly aware of the solar logos through its effects on them and the planet. In that sense, it seems that we are only dimly aware (if at al) of a solar logos and the gods through what we see in the material world, and as we evolve, we begin to gain more immediate awareness on the other planes–astral, mental, eventually spiritual?

Are the Divine Sparks here still the not-quite-as-great Cosmic Atoms that traveled along with the Great Entity to the 7th Circle from the Cosmic perspective as mentioned back in Chapter 10? Or are these Divine Sparks different in that they are more of a mirrored-image of sorts contained within the Solar System perspective…, although the Solar equivalent of a Cosmic Divine Spark sounds more like a traveling seed-atom in this case… still trying to properly grok.

Hi John Michael,
Is it my imagination or am I detecting Dion Fortune’s Christian roots when you write that her metaphor suggests that: “Remember that the Solar Logos is aware of the Divine Sparks, just as they are (in a much more limited way) aware of the Logos”?
I’m curious as to how such a metaphor works with the precepts of a series of aware but unconcerned entities?
Fascinating stuff.
Cheers

Now I’ve read your commentary to Chapter 8 (revised edition) and made a first reading of the chapter itself. Your commentary caused me to bring several threads together that I didn’t see mentioned in the Chapter 8 comments and that I would like to present for your comments.
You have stated in a number of places in this and your other blog that you perceive people to be acting in some very strange ways, which is also my perception. You’ve suggested also that there might well be things going on at the level of the gods (or really any level above the level of humans) that have nothing whatsoever to do with humans but affect us nonetheless. Sort of like when I step on a bug I don’t even see; I didn’t know the bug existed and had no quarrel with it at all, but it’s just as dead as if I did.
This same idea comes up in books 4 and 5 of the Weird of Hali, in which an ancient quarrel among the gods is at the root of Cthulhu’s current predicament and also contributes in part to the ability of the Radiance to commit their act of desecration and to its staying power. Humans had no part in the quarrel (they weren’t even being noticed at the time) and the Radiance’s hold has to do with human choice as well as the straits that Cthulhu’s plight puts the Old Ones into, but without the plight, the act of desecration could have been stopped. (Assuming I remember what I read correctly.)
In your commentary on Chapter 8 you talk about positive evil as being something that happens when one of the Great Entities on a different plane blocks some of the influence of the Central Stillness that our solar system and thus the Earth would normally feel. When this happens discordant stresses are set up that cause atoms to flow either toward the blocking Great Entity (if they are of the same keynote as that Entity) or away from it (other atoms). As Fortune said earlier, this sort of thing can check evolution in a system; here she gives it a label, positive evil.
You’ve also implied, if not stated directly (or if nothing else, I’ve inferred from all of this), that the strange things going on among us humans at this time might be in part related to a Great Entity blockage like this.
I started to wonder if there is a way to tell if this kind of blockage is contributing to the strange things, and if so, on which plane it is occurring. It would seem to need to be something that can persist for many hundreds or thousands of years but that does have a beginning and an end within human history if it’s to be perceived. So I mulled over what kinds of things fit that definition. It seemed to me that one thing that might fit that definition would be the religious sensibility you wrote about in After Progress. In this work you alluded to three different religious sensibilities that are reflected in historical documents, one of which being the sensibility behind the religion of progress that had a beginning and is ongoing (and speculated on the possibility of a new religious sensibility beginning). The sensibility behind the religion of progress is based on the rejection of nature, history, and the human condition. It seems to me that by rejecting nature, history, and the human condition we are basically rejecting ourselves, which makes a good candidate for a kind of strange thing that could result from this sort of blockage. So I wondered if that could tell me something about the plane on which the Great Entity is (if it’s legitimate for me to push the metaphor this far).
Then you wrote in the Chapter 8 commentary: “Positive evil thus takes its most extreme forms in the early phases of any evolutionary process, when the patterns of force that will eventually bring the whole system into balance haven’t yet become habituated.” I thought of a candidate for that which you have also discussed from time to time: the rational mind, which you’ve said is in its early evolutionary phase. You’ve described it as a rickety superstructure perched on top of older well-evolved strata such as what the DA course terms the nwyd and the bywyd. You’ve also said that continuing human evolution will work out the current kinks in the rational mind.
So this idea of rejection of nature, history, and the human condition (a sin, in Fortune’s term) suggests that the plane on which mental processes exist could be affected by a mirror Cosmic plane with a blocking Great Entity on it. This suggests either the 3rd or the 4th Cosmic plane, with the latter being more likely since it’s metaphorically closer. The sensibility itself is emotional/intuitional in nature, but it gets worked on and expressed by the rickety rational mind, which is why I’m considering the blockage as being on one of the mental planes rather than on one of the astral planes which are closer still. But I could easily be persuaded otherwise since I’m still trying to understand how the planes manifest in our mental processes and emotions.
Finally I get to the questions. First, do you see a possibility that a Great Entity blockage could be contributing to our strange thoughts/behavior? At first I wondered if it would matter, but then I realized that if so, the strangeness will have an end, because the blockage eventually ends. That’s a comfort even if it doesn’t end till long after I’m dead. If you do see this as a possibility, do you have an idea of what plane the Great Entity might be on and how it’s affecting us, whether or not it’s similar to the suggestion I made? And finally, does my analysis make any sense, or did I go wrong somewhere, and if so, where?
Thanks for taking the time to thoughtfully read through and respond to all of the comments!

In 1978 I was a freshman; I was going to be a physics major and an astronomer. I ended up taking a different path than this, but this journey through the Cosmic Doctrine and discussion of updating the metaphor for a new audience made me revisit the current big bang theory and think about ways it might diverge from the metaphor of the Cosmic Doctrine. I was struck by two things: first, that the Cosmic Doctrine still resonates so well as a metaphor, and secondly, despite much ballyhoo about how far we have advanced in our understanding, that the big bang theory and the evidence for it stands much as it did when I studied it in 1978; at best we have filled in a few gaps in understanding.  I have spent time this week meditating on the implications if the big bang theory is correct in its assumptions and whether this contradicts the Cosmic Doctrine metaphor. This is just some of what has popped up.
At the heart of the big bang is the “singularity”–the single point that we cannot go back beyond. Scientists admit we don’t know why it was there or the context in which it is embedded, because all the universe we see is contained within the original singularity that expanded; no instrument we have can see back to the singularity, and as we approach that moment, “physics as we know it does not apply” so we do not have the means to currently know it or what lies beyond it (Ring Pass Not). Discussions I’ve seen of the veils of negative existence bear an eerie resemblance to speaking of what is behind the singularity. At best quantum physics is trying to understand what made the singularity expand rather than what caused the singularity. So currently the best answer to why the singularity came into existence is “It was there”–or from the view of the singularity, “I am”.  Even physics is looking at reflections of that event (the temperature of space, whether galaxies are speeding away from us, etc.) just as in this chapter there is talk about how there is something that we don’t see directly but we see evidence of it (such as the planetary spirit seeing evidence of the solar logos through the divine sparks).
What really struck me is how emphatic some who accept the theory are that this singularity came from nothing and there is nothing behind it, when there is no direct evidence that this is true. The best scientists I read admit the shortfall of what they can explain with the theory while admitting that although it currently explains more observations they make and scientists have been able to make good predictions with the theory, there is a possibility that someday it still might someday be overturned.
Which brings me to the contemplation of nothing. When I was young, I ended up needing emergency surgery so that I would not bleed to death. I remember them putting the anesthesia mask on me and the next memory I have is waking up in the hospital. It was as if the day between never happened for me. Just before the surgery, I had almost become a Benedictine nun, and decided not to just before this happened. That missing time in my mind made me eventually question my faith; I had trouble explaining to others that I felt I had touched non-existence, had touched nothingness, and I had a fear afterwards of contemplating nothing.
One of the things the journey through the Cosmic Doctrine has made me realize is that I have to remember that I existed through that whole experience. Although my mind did not make any “tracks in space” that I can access for that time of surgery, at no time did I die or come close to dying. And while the experience made me contemplate atheism and agnosticism, in time I had to admit that the reflections all around me spoke of something bigger than me. And this journey through the Cosmic Doctrine reminds me that although there are many things I may never understand (is there non-existence?  is there nothing?), I can contemplate them, acknowledge my lack of understanding, and release the fear I have of them.

Kimberly, a classic analysis. 
Kay, you’re correct and the bit in the commentary is a typo. Thanks for catching it!
Dan, your higher self or Individuality remembers all that you’ve learned in your previous incarnations; your lower self or Personality has the character you’ve acquired over the course of your previous incarnations, but not the memories. Does that clarify things a little? 
Walt, excellent! The term that’s used in occult writings is typically “substance” rather than “matter;” “matter” is the substance of the material realm, ether the substance of the etheric realm, the astral light the substance of the astral realm, and so on. Other than that, yes, exactly. 
Kyle, the swarms that followed the three primary swarms, but are ahead of us, are now rising back up the planes ahead of us. Occult lore gives them various names, but the point to keep in mind is that they’re intermediary between us and the three primary swarms. More about this as we proceed! 
Dan, that’s certainly one possibility. 
Matt, at this point everything we’re talking about is within the solar system, and the Cosmic atoms have faded from view. The Divine Sparks we’re talking about here are the patterns of movement that affect the seed atoms; the seed atoms themselves were created as patterns of movement by the Cosmic atoms. 
Chris, no doubt! Still, saying that the Solar Logos is aware of the Divine Sparks is not the same as saying that the Solar Logos is emotionally invested in the moment-by-moment behavior of the Divine Sparks…
SLClaire, wow. That hadn’t occurred to me, but you know, you may very well be right. If there is such a blockage, caused by a Great Entity on another plane above ours, it would be on the third plane, the plane of the divine spirit. When a Great Entity comes between our solar system and the Central Stillness, as noted in Ch. 8, the atoms that belong to the plane of the intervening Great Entity are attracted toward that Great Entity, while the atoms of other planes tend to fly outward toward the Ring-Pass-Not. Look at the last 2000-odd years of religion and culture, and what you see is a mysticism that fixates on the spiritual essence of the individual (esoterically, the divine spirit) abandoning the world and flying up to some higher realm, while the life spirit (4th plane), the intellect (5th plane), the emotions and passions (6th plane) and the etheric and physical bodies (7th plane) have been constantly pulled toward wild disorganized extremes. We’ll know it’s passing off when the kind of mysticism that fixates on fleeing the world fades out in favor of one that sees being in the world as holy, and when the vehicles below the divine spirit become noticeably better behaved…
Cat, fascinating. I don’t know enough about cosmology to have an informed opinion about the Big Bang, though it’s never passed the sniff test for me. As for the rest, glad to hear that this course of study is proving to be useful to you.

Hi John Michael,
That claim regarding emotional investment has always seemed a bit far fetched for my tastes.
A lovely commenter on my blog (Hi Lewis!) provided a link to a thoughtful article, which more or less describes how climate scientists are going through the Kübler-Ross phases of grief. Viewed from that perspective the article is fascinating.
The thing is, as divine sparks (as understood in the context that you’ve introduced to me in your essay), the people could forge a new path away from the grief, if only so that others can follow. It is there within them. But the earlier phases of denial, anger, bargaining and depression (which are all there to see in the article) seek solace in the comfortable and familiar, and also avoid the pain involved in introspection upon past decisions (and future desires too, for that matter).
It comes back I feel to exercising the limited free will that you can muster up, or am I mistaken?
The distinct burden of being a climate scientist
Thanks again for prodding our thoughts!
Cheers
Chris

@ SLClaire and JMG: 
Wow is right.
The discussion about the possibility of a blockage by a Great Entity and it’s strange effects on the human race is fascinating and has some disturbing implications. If true, it would explain some things.  I am reminded a little of CS Lewis’ Space Trilogy, in which the Earth is described as having come under the power of a demented Great Entity the Malacandrans call the Bent Oyarsa.

Modern cosmology is quintessentially Faustian. First, there was nothing. Then, it began to expand. Then, the world happened. Then, it keeps on expanding, forever!

								July 15, 2019 at 1:30 pm							




@ Just the usual Baboonery (and JMG) – I got chills when I read the response. The metaphor is more apt than I’d imagined, given the list of effects. 
I also had another thought concerning the possible blockage that is related to your comment. In the book A Wrinkle in Time and the other two books in that trilogy, the earth is shadowed by darkness, as if it’s being eclipsed, explaining the disturbing happenings in these books. That got me to thinking about the uneasiness that is associated with solar eclipses in the cultures I’ve heard about. In the spirit of Chapter 8, in which we are asked to imagine the consciousness of the Cosmos as it forms, I imagined how a blockage would look from the viewpoint of our solar system’s Great Entity. It would look like an eclipse of the Central Stillness. When this eclipse happens our Great Entity becomes conscious of a change in its background conditions, as Chapter 8 discusses. Atoms moves in weird ways; there are stretches and tensions that weren’t there before. I’d expect it to feel uncomfortable and uneasy, metaphorically. Though I haven’t read farther than Chapter 8, I’ll guess based on what I’ve read so far that because of correspondence, if the Great Entity is feeling uneasy when it’s eclipsed, we’re likely to feel uncomfortable when the part of the earth that we are on is eclipsed by the sun.
I wonder if we can use the Cos Doc to learn ways to respond to a blockage that could ease its effects, if that’s what is happening.

Chris, that’s correct. When fate and destiny are more or less balanced — or at least not pulling in the same direction — will plays the deciding role. Thanks for the article on climate scientists — I was pleased to note that there was at least a brief mention of lifestyle change, though driving a Prius and telecommuting is not an especially impressive shift… 
Baboonery, the difference is that there’s no malice involved in the Cosmic Doctrine scenario. Lewis’ “bent oyarsa” is his stand-in for Satan, while the Great Entity on the third plane who’s causing chaos here on the seventh has no intention of doing so, and is simply following the laws of its own orbital motion. What’s more, the influences of Great Entitles on higher planes are among the things causing our Solar Logos to grow and learn, and thus at second hand inspiring us to do the same thing. It’s just that the experience can suck…
Will J, yes, and that’s one of the reasons that I suspect the Big Bang theory will be discarded as soon as Faustian civilization finishes losing its momentum. It’s too obviously a cultural artifact. 
SLClaire, that’s a powerful metaphor, and yes, it makes sense. As for using the Cos.Doc. as a guide to corrective action, yes, although there are limits to how much a few incarnate Divine Sparks can do in terms of the whole solar system and its Logos.







 Cliff says: 



								July 16, 2019 at 11:18 pm							




All right (although this is very late in the comment cycle, and likely no one will read it): 
The Mother Jones article reminds me of the Cosmic Days and Nights in CosDoc. I feel like the US hit the completion of a “day cycle” in the 90s, with the fall of the USSR and a decade or so of stability. This is also when Fukuyama’s book The End of History got big, if I understand correctly. Everything was groovy, it was just going to be neoliberalism and MTV and suburban life from here on out.
Then 9/11 hit and kicked off the start of a “night cycle,” with ramping chaos on all fronts. I feel like the climate scientists are struggling to adjust to the start of this new phase. The article begins, for instance, with a climate scientist growing depressed at Trump’s election because she knew America wouldn’t be tackling climate change. That means she wasn’t paying attention – Obama certainly didn’t do anything substantial, and Clinton wasn’t going to step up, beyond a lot of happy talk.
So the unwary, who thought themselves the lords of Earth, are right now enjoying a huge rush of unpleasant new stimuli, forcing evolution. I feel like there’s a large contingent that are trying to actively resist this evolution, thus introducing positive evil into the system. (Getting a Prius is a rather pitiful change; I’d rather see some of them start to ponder the culpability of materialist culture in creating this whole mess. I’m not holding my breath, though.)

This is even later in the comment cycle, and I don’t expect anyone to read it either, but I was struck with an idea I had to put somewhere where someone might understand it. 
It occurred to me today that one representation of the first – sixth cosmic planes (the ones we can’t see) may actually be in the concept of dark matter – the stuff that the equations tell the physicists have to be there, but can’t be seen, or even produced with an expensive fancy atom-smasher underneath the Swiss-France border. 
Of course, that isn’t what dark matter is, but it’s one way of conceptualising the first-sixth cosmic planes within the context of what we can see – which is the seventh plane, with all its great entities/stars.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Evolution of a Planetary Spirit 
August 14, 2019August 14, 2019John Michael Greer66 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your seat belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 14, “The Evolution of a Planetary Being,” pp. 65-69.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 15, “Evolution of the First Planetary Form,” pp. 91-96.
Commentary:
This chapter continues the discussion of planetary evolution started in the previous chapter, “The Evolution of the Divine Sparks,” adding additional details to this phase of Fortune’s grand metaphor. Fortune begins by briefly recapitulating the themes of the previous chapter, and then spends several paragraphs reviewing the structure of the individual entities that have come into being at this stage of the evolutionary process. It’s worth taking the time to work through what she’s saying here, because it provides—in metaphoric terms, of course—a key to that very large branch of occult philosophy that deals with the subtle bodies of the individual human being.
Fortune sorts out the different parts of the entity as follows:
The Cosmic atom or Traveling Atom—this is the essential core of the entity, the one part that partakes of the reality of the Cosmos and does not simply belong to the dream-body of the Solar Logos—or as we call it, the solar system. Like the Solar Logos, it came into being out of the play of energies in the Central Sun of the Cosmos, but was insufficiently complex to set out as the Solar Logos did on the long journey up and down the twelve great Rays, and settled down instead on one of the seven Cosmic Planes surrounding the Central Sun. It then was gathered up by the gravitational attraction of the Great Entity as that being swept out to the Seventh Plane to become the Solar Logos of our system. The Traveling Atoms then, by their uncoordinated movements, created the patterns of movement in space that became the atomic raw material of the solar system.
As Cosmic realities, the Traveling Atoms are real in a way the atoms of the solar system are not. They are also far more primitive, because the atoms of the solar system, once the Logos begins to coordinate them, receive the imprint of the Logoidal awareness and absorb some of its complexity. The long history of the soul, in Fortune’s metaphor, is the process by which a Cosmic atom not yet prepared to make the journey through the twelve Cosmic rays is prepared for that journey through its initiation by the Solar Logos.
The Seed-Atom—this is the atom within the solar system created by the steady rhythmic movement of the Traveling Atom at rest, and therefore is most directly connected to the Traveling Atom. You can think of it as the representation of the Traveling Atom within the dream-body of the Solar Logos.  You can also think of it as the Lower Self or Personality in relation to the Traveling Atom as Higher Self or Individuality.
The Divine Spark—this is the pattern of abstract movement set in motion by the Solar Logos, which affects the Seed-Atom and functions as the first template of its mind. Each Seed-Atom has such a pattern linked with it, created by the movements of the Seed-Atom in response to the vast and complex dance of the Solar Logos. If the Seed-Atom is the Lower Self and the Traveling Atom is the Higher Self, the Divine Spark is the guardian angel, which is set to watch over the Lower Self until such time as it is able to contact and unite with its own Higher Self, and begin to act on the Cosmic level.
The Seven Shells—these are the bodies the Seed-Atom gathers around itself by its own repetitive movements, and are made of the atomic matter created by the Traveling Atoms in the early days of the solar system. Each Traveling Atom has its own ordinary rhythmic motion, which forms its associated Seed-Atom, but each Traveling Atom also makes other movements in response to the various influences impinging on it from the Logos and from other Traveling Atoms, and when these become rhythmic they create atoms. From the mass of unorganized atomic matter thus produced, each Seed-Atom gathers up a certain number of atoms in its dance, and those form its body on whatever plane it then inhabits.
As we saw in the previous chapter, the Seed-Atoms make their way outward through the seven planes of the solar system, and in each plane they evolve the capacity to build a body of the matter of that plane. Those bodies are the seven shells Fortune discusses. In her taxonomy, they belong to the physical-etheric (1st), lower astral (2nd), upper astral (3rd), lower mental (4th), upper mental (5th), lower spiritual (6th), and upper spiritual (7th) planes. Each Seed-Atom evolves the capacity to build a seventh plane body first, and then adds the others one at a time as it descends the planes to the plane of dense matter, the one we perceive with our senses.
Note the phrasing above: each Seed-Atom evolves the capacity to build a body of the matter of each plane. In terms of Fortune’s metaphor, that capacity consists of a network of tracks in space laid down by repetitive motion, into which atoms of the appropriate plane are then drawn. Exactly the same process leads to the emergence of another category of beings, the one with whom this chapter is chiefly concerned: the Planetary Spirits. (These are called Planetary Beings in the revised edition of Fortune’s text, but I prefer the original term “Planetary Spirit,” as it refers usefully to older occult traditions.)
The Planetary Spirits are “creations of the created,” to use a term Fortune deploys extensively in other parts of her writing. They are not, as the Solar Logos and the Cosmic atoms are, realities on the planes that transcend the solar system; they exist entirely within the solar system, and they are not created not by the Solar Logos, the god of the solar system. They are independent beings in their own right, however, and as waves of evolution pass over them, they themselves evolve, becoming vast and complex thinking beings in their own right. The Planetary Spirit of the Earth is the being that systems ecologists call Gaia, the natural philosophers of an earlier time called Nature, and the natural religions of the world describe as the goddess of the Earth. She passed through immense cycles of evolution long before you and I started on our own evolutionary journey, and our lives on Earth are conditioned by her consciousness.
As already hinted, the evolutionary process that brought her and the other Planetary Spirits of this solar system into being echoes the process by which the Seed-Atoms acquire bodies.  As we saw in the previous chapter, the Planetary Spirits are created by the activities of the swarms of Seed-Atoms guided by their Divine Sparks. Each swarm, as it forms itself into a planetary mass and goes through its evolution on the resulting planet, creates a set of tracks in space that will affect all other entities, and all atomic matter, that come into contact with it. Thus the first swarm builds the planetary forms as it proceeds on its way from the seventh to the first plane; every subsequent swarm is drawn into the form already established. Once it has finished absorbing the influences left behind by previous swarms, it elaborates the pattern of tracks in space further, taking the evolution of the Planetary Spirit further. In the process, each swarm gives the Planetary Spirit the capacity to build the same body the swarm itself is learning how to build in that phase of its evolution.
Did you catch Fortune setting another of her traps for the literal-minded here? The way the metaphor was set out in the previous chapter, each planet exists on its own plane, and each swarm comes to the planet, learns how to build new bodies of the matter of that plane, and then goes on. In the next chapter we’ll be given a different metaphor, according to which the planet of the seventh plane just has seventh-plane matter, the planet on the sixth plane has matter of the seventh and sixth planes, and so on down to the planet on the first plane, which has matter of all seven planes. In this chapter, by contrast, each planet gradually picks up the capacity to build bodies of all seven kinds of matter, until each planet has the capacity to take a swarm of Divine Sparks all the way through the process of evolution right there, on its own surface.
Fortune stresses that the Divine Sparks don’t have to go from planet to planet to gain the ability to take on an additional body, since atoms of all types are everywhere—another shift from the metaphor in the previous chapter, in which the atoms of each type form separate rings extending outward from the Solar Logos. Which of these is the truth about the way the solar system was built?  Ahem. “These images are not descriptive but symbolic, and are designed to train the mind, not to inform it.” The Cosmic Doctrine is not a textbook of astrophysics. It’s a set of metaphors meant to teach you to think in certain ways, so that you can understand the universe in a way that furthers the process of initiation.
Of the various ways to think about Planetary Spirits and the Solar Logos, for what it’s worth, the one that comes closest to the way astrophysicists currently talk about the genesis of planets and the sun is the one given in this chapter. There are, in fact, eight planets circling the sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—along with a flurry of moons, another flurry of dwarf planets such as Ceres, Pluto, and Sedna, not to mention the asteroid belt, the Kuiper belt, and the Van Oort Cloud out there at the solar system’s blurry edges. Getting all this to fit into some kind of sevenfold order would require enough stretching and chopping to put Procrustes to shame.
Thus, if you want to think about the genesis of the actual planet you’re standing on, you can think of each planet as starting out as a pattern of stresses created on the upper spiritual plane by the actions of the first of the swarms—the Lords of Flame, as we’ll be calling them shortly—and being given additional bodies by each of the subsequent swarms, until they each finally sweep up their quota of dust and gases and become physical planets. That said, thinking about the genesis of the actual planet you’re standing on is not the only thing Fortune has in mind here, and the other metaphors also have their place in the structure of ideas Fortune is building.
In terms of this chapter’s metaphor, however, we have a sequence of planets, each with its own Planetary Being. These beings are far from identical, for each one is powerfully shaped by the stage of evolution the Lords of Flame had reached when they were building the Planetary Being’s initial structure. Here we have the basis, in terms of Fortune’s metaphor, for the differing influences of the planets in astrology. On these planets, various beings go through the process of evolution, taking on forms of increasing complexity so that they can absorb the patterns of abstract movement that underlie the forms, and so develop their own capacities.
And the goal of this whole process? That’s the last theme Fortune develops in this chapter.
Each of the entities we’ve been discussing, as already noted, consists of a Cosmic atom linked to a series of movement-patterns within the aura or dream-body of the Solar Logos—the Seed Atom, the Divine Spark, and the seven shells forming its bodies on each plane. The Seed Atom is a creation of the Cosmic atom, the Divine Spark is a creation of the Solar Logos, and the atoms forming the seven shells were created by the Cosmic atoms collectively through their uncoordinated movements at the dawn of the solar system.
The Cosmic atom itself, though, was not created at all—not created, at least, in any sense relevant to the things of the solar system. The Cosmic atom is a younger brother or sister of the Solar Logos, born as the Logos was, out of the surging energies of the Central Sun of the Cosmos. As the Seed Atom linked with it goes through the mighty dance of evolution with the Solar Logos, the Seed Atom gradually increases in complexity and power until it can identify itself with the Cosmic atom that created it. Once this happens, the Cosmic atom has reached a level of complexity and power sufficient to become a Traveling Atom in the Cosmos, and go through the long journey up and down the twelve great Rays that will eventually prepare it to become the Logos of a solar system of its own.
“These last details have never been revealed before,” Fortune says. In making that claim, she’s prevaricating, because they may have been new to the English occult scene in 1949 but they were far from new in any other sense. A nearly identical scheme of cosmic evolution has played a central role in the theology of the Mormon church since well before the death of Joseph Smith in 1844. Where Smith came by it is an interesting question, and I’m by no means prepared to dismiss out of hand the claim that he got it from the angel Moroni—John Dee, very much to his dismay, was introduced to the concept of reincarnation by an angel named Madimi in 1586—but similar ideas can be found all through American occultism and alternative spirituality in the 19th century, and Smith was far from being the illiterate farm boy who sometimes features in both pro- and anti-Mormon literature.
How literally should this part of the metaphor be taken? Any of my readers who happen to be Mormons, or find themselves entranced by such grand visions of Cosmic evolution, are welcome to take it as literally as they wish. My own take, for whatever that’s worth, is that if evolution has some kind of goal—which is frankly an open question—and if that goal is the same for every single being in the Cosmos—which strikes me as a highly questionable claim at best—then the nature of that goal would inevitably be far beyond the reach of the very modest mental capacities possessed by human beings.
What remains to us is metaphor. Christian evangelists in the eighteenth century trying to find a way to talk about the bliss of Heaven to audiences of working class people exhausted by sixteen-hour days in the shrieking clamor and smoke-filled darkness of early industrial factories got the idea across by picturing a realm of luminous clouds and unbroken rest where the loudest sound was the soft plucking of harp strings. In much the same way, the idea of each individual soul becoming the Solar Logos of a future solar system and presiding over the process by which more souls take the same path is, among other things, a potent way to talk about the way that each initiate becomes capable of passing on initiation, whether in the formal setting of a magical lodge or in casual interactions in the course of ordinary life. What other meanings might be extracted from this aspect of the metaphor, and whether to give Fortune’s proposal any credence at all on a less metaphoric level, is up to each individual student of The Cosmic Doctrine.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on September 11.  Until then, have at it!

I’m only just catching up on these cosmic doctrine posts so I’m a bit late to the conversation.
In “Beyond the Wall of Sleep” H.P. Lovecraft has the main character make contact with the spirit of a distant star who says “I am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep. I am your brother of light, and have floated with you in the effulgent valleys. It is not permitted me to tell your waking earth-self of your real self, but we are all roamers of vast spaces and travelers in many ages.” With the ending of the story being the observation of a distant astronomical phenomenon in a newspaper that confirms that the being he encountered was in fact a Star.
It strikes me that he may have been playing around with a similar concept of a potential kinship between humans and celestial bodies that is very similar to this idea that planetary spirits are descended from beings like us and that we could in potential pass through that phase at some point in our evolution. (He also implies in that story that the aspect of the main character that shares a relationship with the cosmic spirit in question is a transcendent part of him that exists outside of time).
You mentioned that this scheme of cosmic evolution showed up elsewhere in the American Occult scene in the 19th century. Is it likely that he’s deliberately playing with one of those other iterations of this concept in that story?







 Isaac Salamander Hill says:

So each of us has a Cosmic Atom at our core, and each Cosmic Atom has the Unmanifest at it’s core. Would the recognition of this Unmanifest by the personality be something like what “Self-Realization” as per Nisargadatta or Ramana, or “Awakening” as per the Buddha are getting at? Then this gradual evolution of the Atom towards breaking past the Logoidal Ring Pass Not and becoming it’s own Solar Logos more of what the Initiation side of ritual magic is about?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								August 14, 2019 at 2:43 pm							




Eric, he was indeed. Lovecraft actually knew quite a bit about the popular occultism of his time, as witness his repeated digs at the Theosophists, and he borrowed various elements of occult lore for his fiction — one of the reasons I’ve found his material so congenial to work with, in my own idiosyncratic way. 😉  Fantasy fiction generally was very strongly influenced by occultism during its mid-20th century Golden Age; I’ve come to think that one of the reasons that so much current fantasy is so dreary is that recent writers have lost track of those once-robust links, and so lack the sense of wonder that their predecessors had in such abundance. 
Isaac, I’m reminded of an old bit of Zen lore: “One man asked about enlightenment. Another answered him. Clearly neither of them knew anything about it at all.” Exactly what realization or enlightenment consists of is known to those who have experienced it, and their attempts to talk about the subject have not done a lot of good. We can, however, hypothesize that something of the sort may be going on here. Just remember that all of this is metaphor…

JMG – 
Am I to understand then from the C.D. that Mars, for example, has its own indigenous, evolving life? Not physical life obviously, but perhaps etheric at its base, and upward …. 
If so, that’s definitely one of reasons why the notion of a human being dying on Mars really creeps me out. As coldly alien as the material Martian surface is by human reckoning, the Martian etheric and astral planes would likely be just as, if not more so, inhospitable to human habitation.

								August 14, 2019 at 4:58 pm							




So if I got all that correctly, the Planetary Spirits are a lot like egregors.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								August 14, 2019 at 4:59 pm							




Will M, certainly from within the Cos.Doc.’s metaphor, yes, every world in the solar system has its own indigenous life, which may or may not be manifested on the physical plane just now. It’s an interesting question as to whether the spiritual beings on other worlds would make some kind of arrangement for the souls of dead astronauts to find their way back where they belong, or whether they’d go, “You chose to come here, and here you stay…”
SpiceIsNice, yes, but remember that the Planetary Spirits been built up over billions of years, where it’s a rare human egregor that’s more than a couple of millennia old. You can gauge their power and complexity accordingly. 







 Wesley says: 



								August 14, 2019 at 10:45 pm							




@JMG –
While I don’t normally follow the discussions of the Cosmic Doctrine, your mention of Joseph Smith got my interest – I am a Mormon and I take cosmic evolution, or ‘eternal progression’ as we call it, as literally as he did.
On the whole, I’ve been warming up as of late to the “traditions of rejected knowledge” which you so often defend on this blog, and getting over the simplistic “occult = bad” dogma that prevails so widely these days. Part of it came through gaining a better knowledge of Mormon history – how Joseph Smith practiced folk magic in his youth, and was influenced by the Kabbalah and other esoteric philosophies later in his life. And part of it came from studying the Bible in the original languages and seeing that “mageia” can be practiced by both good and bad men, while the harsher condemnations of sorcery are reserved for “pharmakeia.” (Just how much the latter overlaps with what the modern pharmaceutical industry does is a matter of debate; my own experience has led me to say “a lot,” but that’s a topic for another discussion.)
So after reading your writings for a while, I’m inclined to say of the various occult movements you discussed that “there ain’t nobody here but us shoggoths” – or in other words, magic often meets a lot of the same needs, for its practitioners, that other philosophical and spiritual traditions do for theirs. I am not, of myself, anywhere close to jumping into the serious study of magic in which you’ve long been engaged, but I appreciate your willingness to buck the trend and take this part of the human experience seriously, even as most authorities, both religious and secular, prefer to wave it aside with a smug assurance of “nothing to see here.”







 John Michael Greer says: 



								August 14, 2019 at 11:14 pm							




Wesley, thanks for this! Ever since I had the chance to read some books about Joseph Smith’s background and Cabalistic studies, I’ve hoped that someday, the Latter-Day Saints will reclaim the magical dimensions of their heritage; as I’ve noted here and elsewhere more than once, the more people who get busy using effective techniques to invoke energies of healing, blessing, and purification, the better for everyone.

I am finding this paragraph very difficult to follow:
“As Cosmic realities, the Traveling Atoms are real in a way the atoms of the solar system are not. They are also far more primitive, because the atoms of the solar system, once the Logos begins to coordinate them, receive the imprint of the Logoidal awareness and absorb some of its complexity. The long history of the soul, in Fortune’s metaphor, is the process by which a Cosmic atom not yet prepared to make the journey through the twelve Cosmic rays is prepared for that journey through its initiation by the Solar Logos.”
What is meant by atoms of the solar system?
Which is more primitive? It would seem that the Traveling Atoms are more primitive, yet these are to become the higher self. So if they are more real than the atoms of the solar system why does it seem to say that the atoms of the solar system will then be imprinted with Logoidal awareness?

Hi JMG,
As usual for me, I can’t really comment or ask intelligent questions about this point in the Cos Doc, it is just too advanced for me, but I’ve made some more headway I think with thought as movement that I wanted to run by you.
One thing that I like about this idea is that it connects action and thinking, so now I can see a way to consider the difference between idle thinking, intentions, simple actions and sustained physical activity.  Having a metaphor is useful, especially movement, because moving objects is something that we learn very early in life, and there are a lot of laws to how things move that I can relate to in a way that I cannot see as clearly with thoughts. With my thinking I tend to be caught up in the content of the thought, but relating it to trying to roll a ball, for instance helps some of the problems become more clear.
One thing it helped me to see is that a lot of thoughts in different directions, especially when thinking about plans for the future, things I might want to see manifest, can cancel each other out, you can’t move simultaneously in different directions.  It’s a bit like a shopping cart when the wheels are misaligned, it’s harder to get it to go anywhere you want.  “Man cannot serve two masters” might be another way to see this.  Rather than thinking of goals as separate solutions for separate wants, if you can find a way to combine them into one greater goal, if you can find an alignment through them you can move towards it with enough force to manifest changes.
Part of what got me here is thinking about space moving, it started to seem a bit like big wheel that could roll forward, and I thought about what might stop that.  Anyway, hopefully it’s not too annoying for you to hear me talking about these basics still.  I’ve found the above has been useful for me in understanding how to consider what I want and it has been causing me to act differently and to think about problems differently.
Thanks,
Johnny







 Johnny says: 



								August 15, 2019 at 6:16 am							




I should say too that the other aspects of this are that thinking this way has helped me to evaluate my goals along this same idea of alignment, “across how many aspects of my life that I care about is this good?”  Sometimes something is good only in a narrow sense and is bad to many others.  Jordan Peterson (sorry all!) described a useful ethical notion somewhat related, that perhaps the object was not just to win, but to win in such a way that everyone else wins through your win.
The other important thing is that there are huge movements that are far greater than any force I can generate, but if I can figure out how to make use of their movement I can take advantage of them and perhaps guide them towards what I would like to see manifest.  At least I can better tell what my humble movement might actually be able to accomplish.
Thanks,
Johnny

The discussion about planetary spirits begun by Will M. leaves open the intriguing question if there is something like a habitable zone for spiritual beings. Even the normal habitable zone for physical beings has shown to me much more complex than originally thought – it depends on many things, for example, the mass of the planet, its atmosphere, its individual history, and other factors. The satellites Europa and Enceladus currently are seen as the best candidates for extraterrestrial microbial life in the ocean under their ice shells.

@JMG
What’s your thoughts on the end of the universe. On heat death when everything ceases to change when the universe dies?
Is oblivion the end of all things?







 Phutatorius says: 



								August 15, 2019 at 10:19 am							




Still following along with CosDoc & pretty perplexed.  However, I must say that Wesley’s comment did more to warm me toward Mormonism than any number of missionaries coming to my front door.







 John Michael Greer says:

Onething, no problem; let’s take it a bit at a time. 
“As Cosmic realities, the Traveling Atoms are real in a way the atoms of the solar system are not.” Remember that the solar system and everything in it is a secondary creation — the primary creation is the Cosmos, and the solar system is created by the Logos as a reflection of the Cosmos. The “atoms of the solar system” are the new atoms created by the movements of the Cosmic atoms — they’re part of the secondary creation, while the Cosmic atoms are part of the original creation. 
“They are also far more primitive, because the atoms of the solar system, once the Logos begins to coordinate them, receive the imprint of the Logoidal awareness and absorb some of its complexity.” The traveling atoms haven’t gone up and down the twelve Rays of the Cosmos, the way the Great Entity who became the Solar Logos has done, and so they’re much less complex (thus, more primitive). The secondary atoms of the solar system haven’t gone up and down the Rays either, but they’ve been directly influenced by the Logos, who has, and so partake of the Logos’ complexity. 
“The long history of the soul, in Fortune’s metaphor, is the process by which a Cosmic atom not yet prepared to make the journey through the twelve Cosmic rays is prepared for that journey through its initiation by the Solar Logos.” Through their rapport with the Seed-Atoms, the Cosmic atoms gradually take on the additional complexity the Logos has, and so are eventually able to begin the journey up and down the Rays and become Logoi themselves. 
Is that a little clearer? 
Johnny, not annoying at all. The whole point of the metaphor is to give you tools for thinking about the world of your experience in a different way; if your reflections on space moving are helping you to do that, all the better. 
Booklover, my guess is that there are different habitable zones for the beings on each of the planes and sub-planes, and conditions on the plane and sub-plane in question — rather than purely physical considerations — determine those. Mars, for all we know, could be a paradise on the upper sub-planes of the Lower Astral Plane, and if you happen to be the kind of being who lives on those sub-planes, you might look over at Earth’s toxic Lower Astral realm and think how lucky you are not to live in so hellish an environment! 
Info, I see that as typical modern mythology. The Big Bang, the heat death of the universe — those are the metaphors our professional storytellers (we call them scientists) use to talk about something about which no human being will ever know anything worth mentioning. 
Phutatorius, it’s perplexing stuff!

Dear John Michael Greer,
I have come late to the party, only just having been tipped off about your blogs on the Cosmic Doctrine by an acquaintance. I am so glad that they did because, although I got a very basic grasp of it through studying for ‘Part One’ with the Society of the Inner Light, I had so very many questions, most of which reading your blogs so far have dealt with head on.
However, there is one question outstanding which actually arises from a vital piece of information you gave in the blog of August 2019. You point out that the first five movements referred to by Fortune on page 31 of the revised edition could be equated with the first five Sephiroth of the Cabalah.
This was real eye opener for me. Equating the Three Rings with Kether, and the the twelve rays and seven planes with Chockmah was straightforward, but after that I am at a loss as what to associate with the next three Sephiroth, as I’m not sure exactly what she’s referring to by ‘movement of the tangentials’, ‘movement of the vortices’ and ‘movement of the composite atoms’. At which point, for example, does the movement of the tangentials become the movement of the vortices (i.e. in relation to which Sephirah)?
I may be making it more difficult for myself because I had assumed that the Cosmic Travelling Atom was at Tiphareth, i.e the Tiphareth of Atziluth which also becomes the Kether of Briah. There seems to be a lot going in to fit in between ‘the ‘movement of composite atoms’ at Gevurah, and the travelling atoms re-emerging from the central sun to take up positions in one of the planes at Tiphareth.
I would be very grateful for your observations on this matter, – and on which Sephiroth represent which subsequent movements!
I searched though all the comments attached to the August 19 blog to see if anybody else had asked that question but could find nothing. I apologise if you’ve answered such a question elsewhere, or in your book ‘Paths of Wisdom’ which I’ve just acquired. If you have, could you simply direct me as to where to look please.
Many thanks for all of this. You also mentioned back in August 18 that you had a publisher lined up for an annotated version of the Cosmic Doctrine. Is it available yet.
With best wishes,
Helen

Dear John Michael Greer:
In an above comment you mentioned your hope that Latter-Day Saints would someday reclaim their magical heritage; well this might interest you, there is a “non-denominational” LDS fellowship which actively studies what they call Mormon Kabbalah, conduct temple rites in house churches, and whose temple equipment reminds me of Golden Dawn derived ritual magic: cjccf.org/tag/mormon-magic/
For the record, I am not, nor have I ever been a Latter-Day Saint, nor is this an endoresment of the above mentioned fellowship; I just find the whole LDS movement, and its esoteric roots, fascinating to study as a uniquely North American form of Hermetic Christianity.
Secondly, I really haven’t been following along with the Cosmic Doctrine book study series, but once I get a copy I definetly will read the whole series and follow along, albeit out of place with everyone else.  In retrospect I’m surprissed at myself for not doing so in the first place, given my interest in everything Dion Fortune related.   
Sincerely,
Christopher Kildare.

I am still wrapping my head around this chapter but I have a couple preliminary thoughts:
“The Cosmic atoms are really younger brethren of the Logos—Cosmic units themselves that have
not reached the development which the Logos has reached but are of the same type. Therefore, each atom of a Logoidal universe is,for this reason, a potential Divinity.”
This seems to me to be opposed to how modern humans think about divine beings. We tend to think about one divine being or many divine beings already here and that there is a set number of them.  But this suggests that the process of creating divine beings is still happening and that there are potential future divinities. It is something I will have to meditate on more.
I also notice in this chapter, as in many others, that Fortune stresses that once something is made of movement, that form then also creates movement : “Abstract movement gives rise to forms in the Cosmos. Forms give rise to abstract movement in a universe, and thereby link themselves on to the Cosmos”. This speaks to constant creation, but also reminds us that our thoughts and actions have consequences–they give rise to movement, which can give rise to forms. What we do and say and think matters.

“the more people who get busy using effective techniques to invoke energies of healing, blessing, and purification, the better for everyone.” Amen, to that! I can’t thank you enough for this discussion of the Cosmic Doctrine. This is the most elevated & helpful blog & discussion on the internet, IMHO. While I’m not able to entirely wrap my mind around the metaphor or reiterate the concepts the way you do, I find it illuminating to allow them to simply flow over me without straining hard to grasp & figure it all out; as if taking a shower in the flowing waters of truth. This as an opportunity to glimpse the magnificence, magic & wonder of this mysterious ungraspable thing that we call Life.

“I see that as typical modern mythology. The Big Bang, the heat death of the universe — those are the metaphors our professional storytellers (we call them scientists) use to talk about something about which no human being will ever know anything worth mentioning.”
Thank you for this. As a former rationalist/atheist I bought into the current scientific world view as The Truth because of course we’re so much smarter than those silly people 500 years ago who thought the sun revolves around the earth, right?  Nowadays I find myself wondering if, 500 years hence, people will be laughing at us for believing in things like the big bang. 
As for this lecture series, I’m the dumb kid in the back of the class who just cannot wrap their brain around the material.  I have trouble de-literalizing (is that a word?) and seeing the metaphor.  Or maybe I’m just not ready for this level yet. Not so much the dumb kid as the 4th grader sitting in a college calculus class.
Thanks for the work you do. Even if I never “get” what this book is trying to tell me, you’ve made a huge difference, definitely for the better, in my life.

I find the frequent, unannounced switching of the metaphors makes it hard to follow the Cosmic Doctrine more than anything else. Still, it’s probably useful to learn to do it, so I’m slowly working my way through the book, but I’m several chapters behind at this point.
With regards to habitability, there’s also another factor: paradise for a polar bear looks like a frozen white wasteland to us: and in the grand scheme of things we’re very close. Extremophiles thrive in radioactive wastelands, and temperatures close to the boiling point, well above anything we can stand.
So it’s very likely to me that there is life that thrives in many environments we call “hellish”, and looks at Earth and wonders how anyone can possibly live here….

Hello, everyone!  I am sorry I am late with novena but we had a family emergency (all well now).  I am submitting it here, since there aren’t many comments yet ,so our host should notice it pretty quick.
JMG, please spruce this up however you see fit!  I’m a novena-writing novice so I can use all the help I can get.
Here it is, with a hefty dose of De Profundis.  Where [Lord] is in brackets, please insert the god of your choice. 
 Out of the depths we cry to you, [Lord].
[Lord], hear our prayer.
Let your ears be attentive to our supplications.
If you, [Lord], kept a record of sins, who could stand?  But with you there is forgiveness so that we can reverently serve you.
We plead help for our crumbling United Sates.  Our rulers are corrupt, our people without hope.  Darkness covers our land.  Renew in us, [Lord], a spirit of hope, decency, and common humanity.  Grant us the strength to stand for what is right and the strength to do it.  
Lead us back to the light and we will praise you everywhere.

There is something that has worried me for some time and I wonder if Dion Fortune’s book addresses it at some point. It is a question of life energy. I see that on our plane of existence, everything eats everything. I have developed a kind of schizophrenic feeling about the natural world. Because I love it, I watch many hours of nature videos and movies. The ones I have been watching here in Mexico seem totally focused on the eating and killing. So I am overwhelmed with images of wild dogs or hyenas tearing into live flesh and eating an animal that is still alive. Of course, not all of the killing is that bad – but a lot of it is. Babies are prime targets. Killer whales chasing a mother and baby trying to get home to the arctic – chase it till exhaustion and then eat only the tongue! At the same time, the beauty of all these animals are mesmerizing to me.
I tend to think veganism is silly and if people are carnivores, as I think they are, refraining from eating animals doesn’t actually change things anyway. The world works the way it works. My husband shoots a deer and I’m glad. We raise chickens and kill the extras because we don’t want grocery store chickens. I do draw a very huge distinction between naturally lived lives such as the deer and chickens who are having a wonderful time as ours are, and animals raised in torturous conditions. But I don’t personally like to pull the trigger.
Perhaps nearly all death is unpleasant.
So my question is, at higher planes, how do entities get energy and do they need this constant ‘feeding’ as we have here?
Yet another aspect of it here is the need to constantly hone and maintain the health of a species and for this competition for territory and mates within the species is also needed, even though that competition can result in some animals being weeded out by their peers.
Lions and tigers are enemies and will kill one another’s cubs.
Some say that negative/demonic entities feed off lower beings like us, are predatory, may even feed off the energy of emotions such as fear, anger and despair. If so, how do angels feed? Do they feed off love, joy and bliss?
Ultimately, where does the energy buck stop? What is the source of energy for beings on the planes?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								August 15, 2019 at 8:48 pm							




Helen, welcome to the adventure! The distinction between tangentials, vortices, and composite atoms takes some study (and some meditation time), but it’s definite. The tangentials are linear movements set in motion by the interaction of the Rays in the Central Stillness, thus they’re Binah to the Rays’ Chokmah. When two tangentials meet, they form a vortex, which is a simple atom — the basic unit of creation in Fortune’s metaphor, thus Chesed. When two or more simple atoms meet and enter into a stable relationship, they become a complex atom which is capable of moving out of the Central Stillness and taking up an orbit on one of the seven Cosmic planes, thus Geburah. Finally, some of those complex atoms become complex enough to begin the journey up and down the Rays, thus becoming microcosms of the Cosmos, thus Tiphareth. At this point the metaphor passes down through the Veil, and the solar system embodies the four spheres below the Veil plus Tiphareth as the Solar Logos. 
With regard to the published version of the commentary, that won’t be coming out until after these posts are done, because the book will be a collected and revised set of these posts! Aeon Books has already expressed interest in bringing it out. It’ll be a few years yet, though. 
Christopher, I’m delighted to hear about the Mormon mages! As for following along, by all means do so as your schedule permits. 
Cat, yep. One of the things that Western occult spirituality got out of South and East Asian spirituality is that souls over vast amounts of time can rise up to the level most of us would call “divine.” Mind you, the beings currently at that status are also rising, so it’s not as though we get to be king of the hill or anything: as an old Druid ritual has it, we pass through portal after portal, and portal after portal appears ahead. 
Shivadas, delighted to hear it! There are many ways to take in what Fortune has to say, and just moving with the flow of words and imagery is a valid one — it’s what happens in initiatory ritual, for example. 
Kid, you’re welcome and thank you. Don’t worry about trying to make sense of it all at once; my first half dozen passes through the Cos.Doc, I was basically blinking and floundering, trying to drink occult wisdom out of a fire hose. It takes repeated passes through the text before things start making sense — just as it would if you picked up a physics textbook for the first time, with no previous exposure to physics! 
Will, it’s deliberate. Fortune is telling you “Slow down and pay attention!” 
Veena, hmm. Weren’t we talking about doing a much more specifically focused novena?
Onething, in occult philosophy the energy that sustains the cosmos starts at the highest levels of being and works its way down the planes to the dense material levels of existence, the ones we experience with our senses. The higher you go, the less conflict there is, because conflict is the result of form: the more fixed a given form is, the more you need conflict to dissolve it, until finally you get to a wolf killing a deer, because the deer is a dense material form for energy and the only way the wolf can extract it is with its fangs. The dense material levels are difficult and painful, no question; it hurts, in a galaxy of ways, to confine the life force to so rigid an object as a physical body; but it’s necessary, so that each soul can become a fully individualized being, a microcosm of the Macrocosm.

Hi JMG,
I thought we were working on clearing the nation’s evil egregor?  At any rate reword it as you see fit, I’m a novice novena-writer so I’m sure there’s plenty of room for improvement.
(What we need, oddly enough, is a good Independent Protestant preacher.  You can wake a good one up out of a sound sleep, prompt him with no more than “Lord, we just…” and he’ll take that tiny little 3-word prompt and snowball it into a magnificent exhortation to the Lord before he goes back to sleep.  I think the secret is the “just”s.)







 Dumb question says: 



								August 15, 2019 at 10:08 pm							




Ok, this is odd…
I read this: “ the more fixed a given form is, the more you need conflict to dissolve it, until finally you get to a wolf killing a deer, because the deer is a dense material form for energy and the only way the wolf can extract it is with its fangs. ” and a voice in the back of my head says “So that’s why Jesus had to be nailed to the cross” 
I’m not Christian, partly because the whole crucifixion thing never quite made sense to me. But I was reading from the book of John yesterday (not something I often do) and the bit where Jesus says “Nevertheless i tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor [the Holy Spirit] will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.”  John 16:7 RSV
Is this sort of what he meant, that his material form had to be torn open to release the energy of the spirit, or is my brain just tired? Yah i know “an excellent topic for meditation.”   my meditation list is getting soooooo long….

								August 16, 2019 at 5:51 am							




Hi JMG,
Thank you.  Because it is such a complex image she is trying to get us to hold I find my ability to use it expands as I think about it.  Even just thinking about the connection between the movement of thoughts and action (like I was describing in my earlier post) made me realize that I can also continue to judge the amount of movement in a physical act and use the same sort of logic to rank acts which are more swept up in passing tangents that will direct an action out of alignment with this movement and which are truer to the goodness of my cosmos.  This seems to relate to the atoms passing along the rays and picking up tangential movements.  Like following the course of a line of movement picks up complexity from the possibilities that arise from this journey, and maybe that these should be seen as interesting bits of character that don’t have to be followed, in the same way that I have learned to lower the value I place on innovation for it’s own sake (I see this as entertaining potential, which I tend to think of it as white noise, it is full of information and movement of thought, but approaches closely an empty void – it is close to the Unmanifest and possibly better seen as part of the Ring Chaos, allowed to just pass out into the void of nonexistence).  I am not really sure, and I might be making use of her metaphor totally incorrectly, but it was the first time I was able to think with of this bit of her teaching,
Thanks again,
Johnny

Hi John Michael,
What is the Planetary Spirit is antithetical to the Solar Logos? Or does the Planetary Spirit contain the Solar Logos and so by definition they cannot be at odds?
And I tend to feel that the Planetary Spirit has the capacity to sweep (that is the word that comes to mind) should it so choose, Divine Sparks back for another track and turn. I’m pretty certain that the loss is ours too.
I likewise concur, because I observe little in the way of lofty goals. And basically I too reckon my brain cannot comprehend such lofty matters. That does in no way suggest that there are no goals, it seems improbable to me that there are none, I just probably need to do a few more tracks and turns before comprehending such matters. 🙂
Incidentally, my mind is for some reason uncomfortable with your words: “the idea of each individual soul becoming the Solar Logos”. I’m guessing that it is not your belief.
Cheers
Chris

Veena, I thought we were going to be doing something specifically focused on stopping the epidemic of mass shootings. Trying to clear the whole egregor all at once is like trying to get a mountain out of the way by shoving on the slope; it’s more effective to choose something small enough to haul it away, cut that loose, deal with it, and go on. 
Question, that’s something I’ve encountered among esoterically minded Christians more than once. In that way of seeing things, it took the crucifixion, death, and underground burial of Jesus to complete the work of redemption by (literally) grounding the Incarnation all the way down the planes into physical matter. So you may have been tapping into the tracks in space left by those thoughts! 
Johnny, excellent! That’s the point of using this kind of complex metaphor — it’s the mental equivalent of a good workout, stretching your mind and then having it do some heavy lifting, so it can accomplish things it couldn’t do before. 
Chris, since the Planetary Spirit is created by the first of the three swarms, and each entity in that swarm is guided by a Divine Spark, the Planetary Spirit comes into being oriented toward the Solar Logos, and the process by which it becomes aware of the Logos completes what amounts to its initiation. So the Planetary Spirits are in harmony with the Logos — if they weren’t, you’re right that the results would be pretty ugly. As for the idea that each soul becomes a Solar Logos in due time, no, I don’t consider that literally true. I tend to think that there are different destinies for different souls, and different classes of souls, even among the swarm we call human beings on Earth. Still, as a metaphor it has some interesting things to teach.

Thanks for the reply. As always there are depths here that need to be contemplated further.I have a day of digging ahead of me, and it is always a good time for such things.
Incidentally, I just wanted to thank you for the time you are taking with us slow pokes, because you are both telling us the story, and giving us a perspective on the subject, but also hinting at the purpose behind it all.
So are you suggesting that Dion Fortune (reaching for a metaphor here) wanted to shake the dust out of her students brains whilst at the same time lifting the mist that obscured their view? Was there any blow back in taking that strategy? My mind tells me that things might go awry from time to time. I can well understand your fondness for the older mystery schools if that is the case.
Cheers
Chris

Thank you for your reply, just trying to apply this to what I think about. Yes, I remember this is a metaphor, all words are metaphors! So in this metaphorical world, the Cosmic Atoms are all of different angles depending on which plane it was hanging around in when the Travelling 10 sided proto-Logos swept it into it’s orbit. Do these corrospond to different orders of beings or are there different sided cosmic atoms within one species, such as humans.

JMG, in your reply to Question you wrote “ ….  it took the crucifixion, death, and underground burial of Jesus to complete the work of redemption by (literally) grounding the Incarnation all the way down the planes into physical matter. So you may have been tapping into the tracks in space left by those thoughts!”.
Re: “tapping into the tracks in space “ – would this be akin something that Jesus, and in fact, many saints (of all religions) have said about their eventual physical deaths, that they would in effect do better work once they were out of body, that is, their entrance into the upper planes would make it easier for the incarnate to tap into their spiritual vitality? Or would that be distinct from thoughts leaving space tracks?
BTW, I have read the same applies to great artists, that the deaths of a Bach, Beethoven, etc., provide incarnate artists with new sources of inspiration and creativity. 
Also, re: spiritual habitation on other planets – Jacob Boehme stated somewhere in his writings/revelations that (I paraphrase) *there is no parsec of space that is not inhabited*. I would take this to mean that not only are all other planets inhabited, but all of space itself, what the material eye perceives as mind-blowing cosmic abysses, is also inhabited. This makes sense to me if the Cosmos is in a sense one living organism, a macro composed of micro-organisms.

OK, now I don’t feel so bad about being overwhelmed by CosDoc. I am falling behind in my readings these days (more pressing worldly matters are occupying my time and attention), but I hope in a month or two to get back at it.

 Johnny says: 



								August 17, 2019 at 6:19 am							




Thanks JMG,
I appreciate the time you are taking with us to help us through this.  I was very interested in systems theory but my brain could never quite make it click, that was part of what I was hoping to get from this, and I think I am starting to make some headway.  I was reading Lean Logic the other day and he was describing a loop that was just like Fortune’s day with two day/night cycles (a positive day/night and then a negative day/night).  He wasn’t quite using normal systems jargon, I think he was also trying to make it more accessible to layman, but I could see that it was the same basic thing, form an idea (presumably a way of getting more good according to your cosmos) then act on that idea (try to manifest the plan), then judge the results (according to your same goodness), then work to remove what isn’t useful for your purposes.  None of it makes sense without intention that is relative to this “good” that must be self defined within the system.
A few years ago the programmer that created Yar’s Revenge for the old Atari video game system was in town so I went to hear him talk.  He described the process of development on games in similar terms,  They came up with some idea, then they worked to realize it, then once they got it into a playable form they just tried it out and figured out what was fun about it (typically not what they expected), then they cut what wasn’t working and reworked their idea towards this new sense of what was good.  The important bit here, I think, is that good isn’t just a plan, it’s something that you react to and can sense, and so the whole system is pulled towards this.  Certainly I have noticed that when nature seems to want something done, the necessary parties like doing it.  It also shows how we can get sucked into pleasure traps this way, you can get pulled out of alignment by positive feedback that seems to deliver more and more good.  This concept of good being relative to your particular alignment allows you to explain why you like something that might be bad for you, which seems like something we struggle with and often requires very large myths and stories to explain.
Really, we can follow a series of likes all the way out of alignment with our initial goals, and this offers us a way to evaluate these different goods against each other.  Like, “why do we like to waste energy so much?” Oh, because we enjoy it and it feels good.  How good is that as a long term plan if our goal is to have happy lives on this planet?  Oh, not great because it puts us in a precarious, possibly fatal spot long term. Well then we should change our behaviour and try to line up (and limit) our sense of having a happy life within the greater cosmos of the natural systems we are part of.  It doesn’t make sense for me to engage with things that aren’t aligned to my goals, but it’s not a big deal to realize that I might want them, and rather than decide I am a bad person for that, I should just not worry about it or define myself that way, instead focusing on the things that are aligned to my goal letting these other things drift off.
Earlier I had understood part of this, and thought in ways the Cos Doc was like Spinoza’s Ethics, but the big difference is that his system is fixed where there is The One and everything falls into line (and should enjoy that), but hers is more relative and applicable in many different situations as a tool,
Thanks,
Johnny

Veena, fair enough. One additional suggestion: focus on what you want to ask for, not on the things you want taken away. That’s as valid in prayer as it is in affirmation…
Chris, Fortune was trying to do in print what an old-fashioned occult order does with ritual initiations. No question, there are risks, but they’re basically the same: people can just fail to get it (in lodges, this is termed “failure to initiate”) or they can go too fast and get it in a one-sided and incomplete way. I’m pretty sure one of the reasons the Cos. Doc. is so dense and difficult was that she set out to make it impossible to rush through; you have to read it over and over again to understand it, and each reading gives you another shot at getting a more complete picture. 
Isaac, Fortune doesn’t say! Myself, I’d say that there are humans whose Cosmic atoms are of every kind — that would explain the diversity of basic outlook that happens even in families and close-knit communities. 
Will M, I think it’s a little different. There are things you can do in the afterlife, provided that you’ve reached a certain level of awakening in this life, that go very far beyond what you can do while still in a body. You need to go through physical embodiment to pick up certain capacities, but it’s when you’re no longer in a physical body that those capacities really come into their own. As for space, have you by any chance read C.S. Lewis’ Out of the Silent Planet? He makes a very similar point — one shared by many mystics — that what we think of as “empty space” is actually full, and indeed more densely filled than what we think of as solid matter. 
Ron, glad to hear it. 
Johnny, excellent! Yes, exactly.

“Tapping into the tracks in space…”. Wow. Yes, I’ve definitely been tapping into something lately.   Books have been appearing in my life left and right, popping up like mushrooms after a rain.  Waite’s book on the Kabbalah, E. D. Walker on Reincarnation, Aquinas, Jung, Ficino… the list goes on. It almost feels like an avalanche. I’m being buried in books, they’re coming so fast I can’t keep up with the reading.
And I’ve been feeling pulled toward going to church, of all things. Not back to the protestant baptist I grew up in and rejected 30 years ago, but the Episcopal church, which I’ve been in maybe twice in my entire life. I had been resisting, but yesterday afternoon I finally decided I will try it this Sunday (tomorrow). I did a geomantic shield chart for 2 different churches with 8:30 am service for one (within walking distance, but feeling somewhat ambivalent) and 11:00 for the other (requires driving, but the pull is stronger).  For the first I got LW carcer, RW amissio, judge Fortuna Major. For the 2nd I got LW conjunctio, RW acquisitio, and so again Fortuna Major for the judge. I’m still very much a beginner at this, so I was hoping you’d help interpret? The appearance of FM in both seems to strongly say YES but I’m wondering about the unfavorable witnesses in the first?

Hello JMG,
The idea of “twelve rays” (or more general use of number 12 in various religions) seems to have originated from 12 signs of zodiac in ancient astrology. However, if we include the Ophiucus constellation, we have 13 zodiacal signs. Why is number 13 not revered (or used) as much as number 12 in religious and mystical symbolism?
Thanks,
M.

My apologies for going off-topic on this, and if you choose not to let it through I won’t be bothered – there’s always next Wednesday.
Seen on Twitter, from Dr. Andrew Thaler.
So I just put in an $80,000 grant proposal to build the next-generation virtual conservation conference. It’s a long shot, but it’s time we had a real alternative to flying hundreds of people halfway around the world.

JMG, thanks, and yes, I’ve read Out Of The Silent Planet. When I first read it at age 14-15, in terms of sci-fi it was a little too theological for me; when I re-read it several years ago, again in sci-fi terms, it wasn’t quite theological enough for me, heh. Rollicking good read though.
My impression was the eldila are essentially angels, and as far as inhabiting space goes, can’t angels be said to inhabit anyplace they choose or are directed to inhabit? I was imagining that there is, say, a certain form of life that inhabits a certain area of space in the same way that there are spiritual beings that inhabit the planetary area we know as Mars, and likewise for any area of space, there are indigenous inhabitants. A universe composed of life, in all places and at all levels, save perhaps for the Center Stillness, which can’t be defined as “being”.
Speaking of planets that are out of sync or detached from a Solar Logos – there are said to be a lot of “rogue planets” out there, just floating about deep space. D. Fortune may written something about this in her own prescient and metaphorical fashion, but I don’t think I’ve come across it as yet. A bit spooky, but I have to wonder if the rogues are inhabited in any manner. I imagine that the rogues are in a sense, “searching” for a sun, a Solar Logos to adapt them, and in cosmic time, I like to think it’s inevitable they will find them.

Dumb Question,
After I moved to North Carolina, in my loneliness for the Orthodox Church, I visited the Quakers and went to the service of lessons and carols at Christmas time in the Episcopalian. Sometimes Episcopalians have more common ground than the Roman Catholic or at least less strong disagreements. That service was sublime and especially if you like old English things. 
The Quakers were as different to what I was used to as possible except for one important thing. Their total lack of structure or service reminded me of the unstructured space in real Orthodox churches, which more and more of them are lazily getting away from (pews). But I digress.
I wonder what their theology on the crucifixion is. The Orthodox Church, alone so far as I know, does not teach that “God demanded a death” to even a score. They think that the crucifixion was done out of man’s sinfulness, full stop. An archbishop once told me that when God confronted Adam and Eve after their fall, he was ready to reconcile with them had they repented.
They say that the salvation on the cross was one of love, wherein humanity would reach the depths of repentance due to seeing what God/Christ had done for them. A reconciliation of the heart. Yet they also sing at Easter that death was conquered by Jesus’ resurrection. I like this because it reminds me of the places in the gospel where he talks about leaven. As a metaphor, Jesus, our brother, who is one of us, uplifts us all because he is the leaven in the loaf of humanity.
I also consider how in the first pages of Matthew, he says a man has no greater love than to lay down his life for his friends. Perhaps a statement like that couldn’t be just left to stand unmanifested.
I believe the Christian path is one of achieving a very high level of love (as Buddhism is about nondual awareness) and so the insistence upon making the crucifixion a physical/legal necessity is unbalanced. Nonetheless, in order to save the entire cosmos from the fall, the physical must be included. Then too, Christ is supposed to have gone down to Hades and preached to the dead and lifted out all who would come.

Onething,
Thank you very much for your reply. You have mentioned the Orthodox Church many times in our host’s blogs, and I always read your comments with great interest. In fact, after one of your comments a few months ago, I looked to see if there were any Orthodox churches in the area, as I find some of the beliefs you have stated to be more sensible in my mind than many other church doctrines I have been exposed to. There are two, it turns out. Both quite small, and one of the two seems geared toward recent immigrants (there is a large university in the area – we have a wide variety of nationalities here!). The problem for me is, I’m already feeling somewhat nervous about this whole returning to church thing, and the links one of the churches provided on what to expect in an Orthodox service seemed so different from anything I know that I would be terrified to walk into one of those churches without a guide. The two Episcopal churches I’m considering are both large enough I can probably hide out in the back pew or something.  The one that is pulling more strongly, I _almost_ feel ok about (They had the building open for tourists to view their stained glass windows a while back, and I had a sense of comfort and peace while I was walking around looking at them. I’m hoping that sense will still be there when there is a service going on) 
 I have no idea where this is leading. I have learned over the years, however, to recognize when changes are coming, and whatever it is I’m being prepared for, its going to be big. (As in a big change in my life. To the rest of the world it will probably matter not a whit).
And yes, a big part of the problem is that I’m not particularly fond of Y*** and He knows it. He doesn’t seem to mind as long as I stay polite and show proper respect, but I suspect if I join a Christian church I will be expected to cease working with other deities.

JMG:
I apologize for taking the conversation off on a tangent. I confess I have nothing to add to the discussion on the Cos Doc, as I have not read the last two assignments.  I find this book so utterly baffling that I am unable to even form an intelligent question!  And with so many other books showing up right now, I have simply let it slide. I did take some comfort in reading your statement that it took you several tries to get it. If someone like you didn’t get it on the first try, there’s absolutely no reason I should expect myself to. I will put it back on the reading list, save these lessons, and hope that by the time I circle back to it, I will be more ready to hear its message!

Well, the Saturn sun theory is that Saturn was a red or brown dwarf, earth and mars were its satellites, and we had a very warm and hospitable, womb-like existence. Then we began coming toward our present sun, there were terrible shakeups, violent upheavals. In the old system, the north was actually the warmest place, but all the earth was bathed in warmth due to a quite different system in which were in an envelope-like plasma sphere. Venus was not yet born, as per the ancient myths. Even the moon was not. At least, not here, not in our sky. Mars may have harbored life, but was destroyed in the upheavals, esp with Venus.
I think it is early to use terms like rogue. But it does seem odd to me to have a system wandering around, not part of an organized system. That is, the system was organized and long lived, but was making tracks through space. Who knows what might cause that.
This theory is tied in with electric universe, which I find to be a better explanation for things like how stars, galaxies and so on form.

It reminds me of what I’ve read Indigenous nations say about killing wild animals for food, that these animals lay down their lives so that their kin in the form of humans can live. That would be true of course for the whole food web of life.

Thanks JMG,
I think this is the way reading this has started to affect the way I’m living my life.  I feel like if I were to split my personality into two halves, one would be the more intuitive, impulsive side, and the other would be the more considered, deliberate side.  My problem has been that the intuitive side is very often right, but some times wrong – and sometimes wrong in a big way (even if it’s through hundreds of small mistakes, following too many stray paths), and the more considered, deliberate side tends to over think and not be able to act (it’s like the arrow that can never hit it’s target), but it’s far better at evaluating the bigger picture.  I think this has helped me to integrate and evaluate these two things a bit.  I think the “tracks in space” concept also helps to explain why the intuitive side can be so much more successful than the considered side, because it can just get into these grooves.  So it’s getting a lot of free stuff just because it’s open to receiving it.  Like in an example like dancing, something I enjoy doing, I don’t understand how to dance, I mean I don’t know how to make my body do specific controlled things in a graceful way, and so I never did it and thought it was just something completely beyond me, until I learned that I could just not think about that at all and let this “other side” somehow channel movements based on how they feel from the inside, then it’s a process of just letting my body have fun and the problem suddenly goes away.  Oddly enough, I’ve often pictured it as literally interacting with invisible objects and motions that I could “see” (this is years prior to Cos Doc reading, so just a strange co-incidence) .  But, since dancing is something where there is a lot of energy flying around, particularly sexual energy, I’ve learned that I need certain rules if I’m going to go do it at all, mainly that I don’t drink when I go do it, and also that I move away from certain types of attention.  Those sort of rules need judgement against greater standards, so they are more for the considered side, and so they are more integrated and the intuitive can serve the controlled.
We want to be open to these prior movements, these tracks in space that keep spinning, because we can take advantage of their existing depth and power, it’s like standing on the shoulders of giants really, with much more movement than we could generate by our own deliberate acts of will (just pushing a boulder up a hill through sheer effort), but we want to make use of these according to our own goals, ideally the cosmos that seems most applicable to the greater purposes in our lives, the cosmos that (hopefully) we try to align to the greater cosmoi of the forces at work in our times and maybe the larger purpose of human beings. 
It might be a fluke of history that we are able to control our impulses, but it does seem like that brings us into the area of cultivation, somewhere between the chaos of wild nature (great for it, not always great for us) and our dream of the conquered nature (an illusion for the short term and a danger in the long term).  With the right perspective and judgments we can create gardens in nature with a light touch.  Something that serves both our needs and it’s own.
Thanks,
Johnny

Seems to me the Cosmic Doctrine is a general primer explaining general occult science.  Modern science looks at material plane phenomena only whereas Cosmic Doctrine looks at all the planes that created material phenomena and without which the material plane would not exist.  Since modern science can’t manage to acknowledge the etheric, mental, and spiritual planes let alone investigate them, the literal and scientific minded are up a creek.  Modern religious people have similar thought-stoppers cemented in place by literalism.  In Monty Python’s The Life of Brian, Brian’s followers chase their charismatic leader in hopes he will give them a miracle or sermon of wisdom.  When he loses his gourd and his shoe while running, different factions of followers separate into squabbling cults of the Holy Shoe and the Holy Gourd.  The shoe/gourd sketch epitomizes modern religion for me.  It puts the cart before the horse.  One starts to realize the genius of the ancient Druids for never putting anything in writing.
Seven notes and twelve tones of the scale, at least in Western equal temperament, which is the only one I even partially understand.  The Seed-Atom needs to be able to play every tune in every key, not just C major, so it goes about putting on layers of education.  I am seeing that each of the various “keys” we learn how to play in can be an entire class of incarnations the Seed-Atom soul has to go through in order to get to human incarnation, and then once we are here in human incarnation, the whole thing ramps up and then we must be born as every human type, proclivity, and zodiac sign.  For instance (spoiler alert I’m about to sound like a fruitcake even more than usual) I think I remember being a goose, not just a silly goose like I am now but an actual goose, or at least some kind of migrating bird, and also a cat.  I was a cat several times.  No idea when this was, obviously it was long, long ago.  I also remember being a Scottish laird, there are memories of a bard/comedian guy, and also a young girl growing up on the East Coast.  This was my Seed Atom going through reactions and building up different layers.  Perhaps the goose incarnation was my Sun in Aries, the first flight after a lengthy series of times as a walking or swimming animal. Hope this makes sense to someone.
There are no literal atoms or literal layers.  The Cosmic Doctrine is the attempt by non-embodied intelligences to explain to us dumbkopfs how forces we cannot see brought us into being.  They are trying to express what the potential is if we make our best efforts to transcend our unfortunate meat suits and the material condition.  They must be patient teachers because we’re not easy to work with.

Dear Question,
I don’t think your inquiry was much off topic. A lot of people ask for spiritual direction and that needn’t be limited to particular gods. Plus, the comments during Dion Fortune weeks are so sparse!
I see you feel timid. I recommend the church geared toward immigrants as it is more likely to retain the old world flavor. I suspect that while there might a a few curious glances, you will be allowed to acclimate at your own pace and left alone. As for a guide, that is where you will probably find one! But I am most emphatically not encouraging you to pick the Ortho Church over the Episcopalian. 
One time many years ago, guess who showed up at our Russian church in Los Angeles? Why, Natalie Wood and her husband Robert Wagner. It turned out to be some sort of holiday in which their was a procession around the church and thus many people. It was about 3 weeks later that she died. She wanted confession and communion. Natalie Wood looked perfectly comfortable because she knew what to expect, but poor Robert Wagner looked so uncomfortable, as if he expected typical mob behavior. But no one bothered them at all. 
I actually try not to say all that much about this church as I am no longer a member, it’s just that I retain a great love for it and consider it a useful religion. I mostly chime in for a particular reason: at some point my love for God caused me to feel genuine heartache at theology which slanders that Being whom I love so much. So I decided that I am a defender of God’s character, for who will defend Him? It is absolutely not something God will do. It also breaks my heart that these (demonic?) teachings have  greatly impaired that very thing which is the Christian path – love for God and one’s fellow man.
Rather than being something like a ‘recovering’ Christian, I left the church because I no longer believed some of the teachings. I don’t think we know or can know who or what Jesus was. Too many lies and fabrications. I believe in reincarnation.
What happened to me is between me and God. Orthodox Christians will not be able to accept it. I did an intense search and meditation on what the essence of the Orthodox Church was and read a book by an obscure monk written in the 1930s. This man, whom I consider my mentor, I found out only recently has been canonized. He lit my soul on fire with his pen. So fitting for a bookworm such as myself. What I had was a life changing experience of the Holy Spirit who then slowly but surely began to teach me. What happened next shattered me, a dark night of the soul, total cognitive dissonance. Again, books. Some months later, living in bliss, I found adequate evidence that the church and its truths, including the Old Testament were not true. This was horrifying to me because, like a near death experience, my spiritual uplift was something more real than life itself – I could not doubt it and it had come to me through this church which I loved more than ever!
I struggled a long time over this but ultimately clung to God alone, let everything else go, and slowly rebuilt. The first thing the Holy Spirit taught me was that God is good. From this many other realizations follow. And as Jesus promised, the Holy Spirit set me free. 
I hope that whatever you choose to do, you will have the strength to be self-standing. Let you have your own understanding. In the gospel of Thomas there is a strong hint. It says that while many are standing around the bridal chamber, only he who stands alone will be admitted. This is one of the spiritual lessons we are here to learn. You must be a mystic, and know God enough to know when to say no to the teachings of men.
My mentor was at one time harassed by the other monks because they saw he had lost his fear of God. He said it was a truth that was not for everyone, that one could be taught directly by God. Those for whom this is true know who they are, but others cannot fathom it.
Basically, what seems to be going on here in this world is that evil and good are just all mixed up and thus we are all confused. One of the gems from the Old Testament – Woe to those who call evil good and good evil. I realized this is the human condition!
Once you understand that God is good, the scales fall from your eyes.
One of the most useful tools in the New Testament is this: “We tell you this that your joy may be full. God is light and in him is no darkness at all.”
If you use this chisel properly, it will help you understand my position. God has no part in the negativities attributed to him in either the Bible or theology. There is no reason to fear God ever, no more than you fear your next life giving breath.
You might want to check out gnosticism, too.

A few random thoughts, in no particular order…
The concept of “a definite system of stresses and reactions which are intercompensating” which “have achieved an equilibrium and thus become stabilised” (Chapter XIII) reminded me of the construction of a house or a building, which basically is a series of inter-connected spaces made habitable by surrounding them with walls and roofs that remain standing and stable by means of intercompensating stresses.  
There is an interesting connection to stimulus and attention (still Chapter XIII).  When a rhythm “settles” it becomes monotonous and ceases to interest the Great Entity, which withdraws its attention from the monotony of the satellite, which then lacks the external stimulus of the attention and “sinks into subconsciousness”.    Does this suggest that Solar dream-forms which have settled into a regular rhythm, and no longer hold the attention of the Great Entity, can fall into a sort of sleep (stereotyped reactions) for an extended period, until some new tidal shift awakens them?
I am still uncertain of the ways in which the travelling atom, the seed atom and the divine sparks connect to one another, as described in the text, but the commentary above (which relates them to personality, individuality and Guardian angel) helps somewhat.   
What I do vaguely grasp is that there is a process being described in this chapter, which concerns ourselves and our destinies, in that each of us is in train to discover and unite with our “Cosmic creator” (is this our own travelling atom, or the original Great Entity of the original Cosmos that both the travelling atom and the Solar Logos were formed in?? If the latter, that sounds like a very big “ask”…) and gain the capacity to evolve into a Great Entity.  This is still too big of a task to comprehend, but I can make some sense of the progression from being created (by the Cosmos) to being conditioned (by the Universe) to reaching the free and independent state of being able to condition oneself.  
I missed much of July, having been travelling to see family, and hope to have caught up again by next month.  I do expect that there will still need to be more readings before getting a lot of sense from the text.  However, I can attest that a second reading shows up a lot more than the first.  *Raises glass to many more*.

JMG
I slid off along several tangents so far this month. Mostly I have been thinking about the meaning of words and the part words play in our thinking – they seem to come and go in the cognitive processes. ‘Atom’ used to  have a strict definition as ‘indivisible’. They still do have strictly defined terms, as in the Periodic Table. 
I try to follow Fortune ‘meanings’ when she is talking about ‘entities’ and ‘parts of entities’ and uses the concept of ‘evolution’ over time. Which has made me wonder about other terms / words such as ‘complexity’ and its equation with  ‘power’ / ‘capacity’. 
Hmm … I have needed to think about ‘what is a metaphor’ and what is ‘symbol’, and what is language’s part in the wider functionalities of cognition?  Fortune’s words constitute metaphors, which are words or groups of words, but are not apparently symbols – rather they are abstractions with no obvious symbolic and  meaningful representation, at least as they might be if they were symbols like the symbols in the Periodic Table. The latter does not seem to be the case. 
I find the consideration of relations between words and ‘thought forms’, whatever these might be, fairly fruitful so far, if very inconclusive. Smile.

Phil H







 philsharris says: 



								August 19, 2019 at 6:45 am							




PS
It is Fortune’s words that I have whatever problems with. Words used in ‘metaphor’ bring with them  a representational definition even if the metaphor is not itself a representation, i.e. is not a symbol. But Fortune seems to have detached many words from their definition. 
OK, probably a good thing.

Onething, 
Would you be willing to have a conversation about things off-blog?  I have many questions I’d like to ask you, and I’m afraid I’ll be trying our host’s (and other readers) patience if I try to post them here.  I’ve made a new gmail account not wanting to put my regular email out in an open forum, so if you’re willing to talk, you can reach me at wholelottaquestions at the aforementioned mail server. Or if you’d rather not, would you be willing to share the name if the monk and or the title of the book you mentioned here?
What you wrote above really hit home for me – one of the issues in going back to church is knowing perfectly well that much of what I believe conflicts with what they teach. Your comments about God’s character being misrepresented hit me in particular.  He has tried to tell me he’s not the abusive father as portrayed in the bible. I’ve not believed him. In one of JMGs Hali books he has a character say that building up false expectations and bad reputation is done by the materialists to discredit the gods (I’m paraphrasing a bit).  When I read that, I got goosebumps, which is my body’s way of telling me “pay attention.”  
I went to the 2nd of the two Episcopal churches yesterday, the one with the windows. The experience was intense, to say the least. I’m still processing it. I spent most of yesterday afternoon sleeping or wandering in a daze, feeling rather like I’d been run through with some sort of spiritual pipe cleaner.  
I had a conversation recently with a devout Roman Catholic, after I had rather impertinently asked how he could stand to be Catholic, given the history of abuses and violence in that church.  He spent approximately two hours answering that question and what it comes down to was this: people suck. Any organization made of people will suck. You just have to keep the channel to God open, and he feels the rituals and sacraments of the Roman Catholic church do that for him. 
And yes, the gospel of Thomas is one of the books that has landed in my hands in the last couple months. I’ll bump it up to the top of the reading list.
Thanks

The shells are different states of consciousness, states of awareness to which we can possibly evolve. The Cosmos projected both us (Cosmic atoms) and the Logos, so we’re essentially the same, but we are at an earlier stage of the journey than the Logos.  We could evolve, we have the potential to evolve, but we’re not there yet. This implies action needs to be taken, changes need to happen, work needs to be done – the work of the initiate. Gradually awakening into new states of consciousness or building the shells, one by one, following the path that has been laid down before us.  Our material forms are just the inflection point in the solar system, the turning point on the return to spiritual states. Not the last word by any means. We think the material world is all there is, but really we lack the senses to perceive the other worlds, if we have not started on the path of building the shells or bodies which would allow us to perceive spiritual levels of being.
“Therefore, each atom of a Logoidal universe is a potential Divinity.”
A lofty goal that, to become divine!  I’ll try not to let that go to my head, and instead re-frame it in a way that makes sense with what is going on in my life right now.  Through magic, the work is to establish a connection to my Higher Self, to gradually become aware of the different spiritual states of being that are as much a part of our solar system as the level of sensory awareness.  They are right here all around me, all the time, and are what actually inform the material world.  I’m supposed to learn from the initiates and divine beings that have gone before me, follow patterns that have been established, build up the different spiritual bodies or shells and allow myself to be conditioned by divine states of consciousness, not just strike out on my own and do my own thing.  Without the work of initiation, I’m being led about by unconscious fears and doubts – those tangential thoughts that are uninformed by God. These unconscious fears distort my decisions, my relationships, and my emotional state.  To me, becoming more conscious of the divine influence on my consciousness is the main goal of the work of initiation – gradually, through exposure to spiritual beings in practices, and then through much reflection, repetition and strengthening of those new tracks in space or states of consciousness, bringing my unconscious fears to awareness, and then clearing them out, letting them go.  Making way for God’s love to enter, and then allowing that love to be shared with the people in my life.  Finally noticing that the way I think and behave affects how people react to me and shapes my life in an exact reflection of my inner state.  In that way, I could slowly start to become the Logos of my own universe.
And as an aside, I just finished reading Kim Stanley Robinson’s amazing book, Aurora, and (spoiler alert) it would seem the designers of the immense ship forgot about the Planetary Spirit in their meticulous yet materialist biosphere design.  Their equally immense hubris must have prevented them from noticing they could not recreate the unique consciousness of the Earth’s biosphere which is what actually holds all of life in balance.

I’m still behind on my reading in the Cos Doc, but slowly catching up as I am soon to finish Chapter 10. Thank you for your commentary on that chapter! I’ve needed it even more than in past chapters to help me untangle the words and visualize the images that Fortune provided.
Regarding this month’s post and particularly your exchange with Chris, do I understand correctly from it that Fortune doesn’t include a place in her cosmology for the Path of Descent as it’s discussed in the Dolmen Arch course? Or was that mentioned in one of the in-between chapters or will it be discussed later on? If the two cosmologies are different in this way, it will be interesting for me to meditate on what that might mean in terms of the kinds of magic that I might do with one or the other as the guiding metaphor.

Wandering Poet, maybe a part of that is the current state of Western Civilization, full as it is with things as Trump Derangement Syndrome, fanatical toxic beliefs about Progress, and so on, and another part of it is the state that other, non-Western societies are in with their own problems. Somewhere J. M. Greer wrote that banishing rituals now are more or less mandatory in magic, whereas in earlier times, this wasn’t as necessary as now (except a bit of frankincense).

Of course I will and will probably answer you a bit here as well. I lost the whole day yesterday because of the treatment at this clinic. While I don’t believe in chemo, they do it a special way with 10% dosages, so it seems to be worthwhile. Even so its a bit rough. Yes, I do think I am seeing improvement, and have to read up today on how to run a funding campaign.
Now, it is off to the “hot box” a hyperthermia treatment.

Question, apologies for not getting back to you sooner! The second is the better reading; both are positive readings, but the second choice is better. 
Minervaphilos, the signs of the zodiac are not the constellations. It doesn’t matter how many constellations there are along the ecliptic; there are twelve zodiacal signs, which are 30 degree wedges of the ecliptic defined by the relationship of Sun and Earth, and represent twelve different modalities of energy. As for why, that’s simply how many there are; you might as well as ask why you don’t have two noses. 
John, fair enough. I wonder if he’s crunched the numbers on the energy costs of a virtual conference. 
Will M, I don’t think the eldila are angels — remember that Malacandra didn’t know that the Incarnation had happened on Earth until Ransom told him “how Maleldil had wrought there.” In the medieval symbolism Lewis was using, the eldila are intelligences, not angels. As for rogue planets, interesting; that I know of, those don’t have a place in Fortune’s metaphor, but it’s interesting to speculate how they might be inserted. 
Question, a good background in Christian theology might actually be a lot of help here — Fortune knew theology quite well and used theological language tolerably often. 
Johnny, another solid meditation. 
Kimberly, exactly. Exactly.
Scotlyn, you may have had to take some time off, but it sounds to me as though you’ve got a good deal of what Fortune is saying. . 
Phil H, yep. She’s deliberately pushing the meanings of words in various ways, to encourage the kind of thinking you’re doing. 
WanderingPoet, that’s where humanity’s mental pollution piles up. All the cravings, hatreds, smoldering resentments, unacknowledged lusts, the whole seething mess of it piles up in the lower astral, until it’s discharged by natural catastrophes. 
Stefania, excellent. Yes, very much so. 
SLClaire, the Path of Descent is part of the metaphor; it takes place as the swarms go down the planes to the material plane, planet by planet, until they reach the material plane and begin the work of return. We’ll get more into that in the upcoming chapters.

If so, it means that we needn’t have some of the catastrophes and natural disasters which trouble people when it comes to arguments about the existence of evil. So many of the evils which people think means God must not exist are actually entirely the fault of people, but natural disasters are harder to find answers for. Additionally, I have wondered about the current outbreak of insanity…its downright eerie. Also, reading a book about a woman who ran hospitals during WWI, I am absolutely aghast at the horrors that Europe went through, the incredible suffering and carnage, and to this day I don’t know that anyone understands why.

Questions,
Father Sylvan. The thing is, after he got canonized his book got revamped and a new title. One of them was called The Undistorted Image. I have both at home but I ain’t at home. His acolyte has an intro almost as long as his book, and he is completely different in his writing style, much more academic. Its also excellent.
I’m so glad you responded to the beauty of the church you visited. You are in flux!
I like your story of asking your Catholic friend how he could belong to that church. I have had the same impulse! While I disagree with him, I also really like his answer.

JMG,
There is a solid empirical evidence that I don’t have two noses 🙂 but is there any evidence that there are “twelve different modalities of energy”? Could you please elaborate on that further? (I mean, one can arbitrarily divide the ecliptic into 10 degree wedges and claim that “these represent 36 different modalities of energy”. Then he/she would have to support that claim with empirical evidence.) 
Thanks,
M.

JMG
Please don’t get me wrong. I’m not trying to discredit all of the theories about astrology, dogmatically. I’m really curious about how its mechanism works. I honestly admit that my background is atheist/materialist, but several years ago, when I read about the findings of scientists like Rupert Sheldrake and Dean Radin, I have become more open-minded and genuinely interested in occult phenomena. Later on, when I read the “The Arcane Teaching” book by William Walker Atkinson, I found most of his arguments rational and plausible (I found it even more convincing than The Kybalion). Since then, I have been reading many books on esotericism and regularly practicing different meditation and visualization methods and observing their benefits on my own psyche.

I have been very busy this week, but ran across this ‘off-current-topic’ article:
https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/the-oligarchys-plans-for-our-future-keep-getting-dumber-52158901091b
We had been discussing monofuture, and what smacked me was this passage in the article:
“I’m going to take a lot of flak for saying this, but I honestly believe that the impulse to colonize space is one of the more pernicious cultural mind viruses in our society. I mean, think about it: we’ve got a planet right here for which we are perfectly adapted, and we’re burning it to the ground while looking up at a red dot in the sky going “You know I bet if I nuked that b****h I could build a hermetically sealed house on it someday.” How much more insane could you possibly get?”
I wonder if the author wanders by this little corner of the interwebz?

The answer to the request for ‘solid empirical evidence’ is, surely as it has ever been:
 ‘He who tastes, knows.’

Since I renewed my study of the occult a couple years ago (I tried to self-initiate as a Wiccan as a teenager and later became an agnostic leaning towards atheist) my rationalist, scientifically-minded husband has asked me “Can you prove Data Point X about these esoteric subjects you’ve been studying?”  For instance, the Druid concepts of gwyar, nwfyre, and calas.  Can I prove the objective existence of nwfyre?  No, all I’ve got are a bunch of hard-won insights from meditation.  If that isn’t enough for my scientific atheist husband, I love him to pieces but it’s truly his loss.  There is no other way of getting the insights than doing the work, and the work isn’t on the physical meat-plane.  There is no proof, only This Stuff Works.

We can not be sure that “this stuff” will never be proven. Until two centuries ago, electricity and magnetism were known as “occult forces”, but then physics developed enough to explain them precisely. Maybe the same thing will happen to nwyfre/astral-light/chi/prana/etc. in the future. Even though there are some dogmas in the current paradigm of science, it may be replaced in the future when the empirical evidence about “vital energy” accumulates up to a certain point. Though these forces often don’t operate on the physical plane, their indirect effect is observable on the physical plane (especially on our bodies).

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: Evolution of the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind 
September 11, 2019September 11, 2019John Michael Greer67 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your seat belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 15, “Evolution of the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind,” pp. 70-75.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 16, “Evolution of the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind,” pp. 97-103.
Commentary:
The construction of the solar system in Dion Fortune’s metaphor continues in this chapter. Over the last two chapters we’ve watched the first swarm of individual beings begin their pilgrimage down the planes of being; we’ve seen how their activities on each plane bring a planet into being, and we’ve watched each planet develop its own Planetary Spirit, which conditions each of the subsequent swarms of Divine Sparks as these descend the planes in turn. Now it’s time to look a good deal more closely at the three original swarms—the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind.
Here Fortune is enriching her metaphor with material that has deep roots in Western occult tradition. I doubt that many of my readers will have encountered the technical terms epiphaniai, epiphonomiai, and ephiomai—literally “appearances,” “voices,” and “acclamations”—which were used for these beings by Renaissance occultists such as Robert Fludd, though I suspect that Fortune knew the terms. To summarize a great deal of lore too quickly, though, the Lords of Flame are the beings that both occultists and more orthodox believers call angels. The Lords of Form are the beings that occultists of various traditions call intelligences or devas. The Lords of Mind are beings to which occultists give various names, of which “inner plane teachers” is probably the most useful. The capacious logic of polytheism tends to give these and other beings such labels as numina or kami; “gods” will do in English.
Let’s begin with the angelic Lords of Flame, the first swarm of Divine Sparks to set out from the Solar Logos and descend through the seven planes of the solar system the Logos has dreamed into existence. (Remember that in our text, when Fortune writes “universe,” she means “solar system”—that was standard usage in her day, at a time when other galaxies had not yet been discovered.)  This first swarm is made up of those atoms that became complex enough in the solar system’s first phases of evolution to take part in the journey up and down the solar system’s twelve rays; they are equivalents, in the smaller scale of the solar system, of the traveling atoms of the Cosmos—one of whom is now the Solar Logos, the god of our solar system. So they come to the work of creating a solar system with much more experience, and much more complexity, than subsequent swarms.
That’s the first thing that sets the Lords of Flame apart. The second is that they begin their work when the solar system consists solely of the Solar Logos and a cloud of atoms around it, dancing to the rhythms the Logos sets in motion. The sole influence on their evolution is the Solar Logos. Later swarms also receive the influences of the Planetary Spirits; the Lords of Flame don’t.
Those are the things that make life easy for the Lords of Flame. The thing that makes life hard for them is that they are the first.  They go, if you will, where no Divine Sparks have gone before. They have to build bodies out of the raw material of the seventh plane, using atoms that have never before been organized into a body; since atoms are nothing more than habitual tracks of motion, remember, this means that the atoms have to be reshaped comprehensively to make their movement-tracks fit the needs of a seventh-plane body. That’s just the individual side of their work. They also have to work together to build the body of a planet on the seventh plane, and the atoms that are their raw material have never been part of a planet, either.
Thus the Lords of Flame have their work cut out for them. When they arrive on each plane, they are surrounded by a mass of unorganized atoms; when they leave it, they leave behind a pattern of forces so intricately coordinated that all subsequent swarms are drawn into it and formed by it.  To use a metaphor from esoteric Masonry, they have the role of Solomon King of Israel, setting out the fundamental patterns and proportions that subsequent workers will follow.
The second swarm has a different task and a different destiny. The Lords of Form or intelligences of nature begin as ordinary atoms of the seventh plane that are drawn into the archetypal form of the seventh plane planet once the Lords of Flame leave it. They gather up bodies of other seventh plane atoms and attune themselves to the Planetary Spirit in the same way that the Lords of Flame did, but they don’t have to do it all from scratch; the tracks in space laid down on the planet of the seventh plane make building a body easier than it was for their predecessors, and they don’t have to create the Planetary Spirit, they just have to learn to work with her.
Both of those advantages come with corresponding drawbacks. The tracks in space that help the Lords of Form build their bodies were laid down by the very different consciousness of the Lords of Flame, and so the Lords of Form have to balance out the resulting vagaries. The same thing on an even larger scale happens when they deal with the Planetary Spirit. On each plane, the Lords of Flame condition the Planetary Spirit, but the Lords of Form and all subsequent swarms are conditioned by her. Each Lord of Form thus has to balance the sometimes conflicting influences of the Solar Logos and of the Planetary Spirit of the planet on which it is incarnate.
The Lords of Form also have a unique function as they work their way down the planes. They come into being on the seventh plane when the Lords of Flame have gone on to the sixth, and build seventh plane bodies; when the Lords of Flame go on to the fifth plane, the Lords of Form proceed to the sixth, enter into the planet that has been built there, and get to work building sixth plane bodies and attuning with the Planetary Spirit of that plane. Then the Lords of Flame go on to the fourth plane, and the Lords of Form are caught between the gravitational attraction of the fifth and seventh plane planets. The conflicting pulls are strong enough that the seventh and sixth plane bodies they’ve built dissolve into their component atoms, and those atoms are caught up in the structure of the sixth plane planet and remain there.
Meanwhile the Lords of Form circle back to the Solar Logos, pick up the Logoidal vibration again, and start out anew.  Since they’ve already built seventh and sixth plane bodies, they do this quickly enough, and land on the fifth plane while the Lords of Flame are still busy at their pioneering work on the fourth. When the Lords of Flame go on to the third plane, though, the same thing happens to the Lords of Form; their seventh, sixth, and fifth plane bodies dissolve, the atoms of which those bodies are made become the raw material of the fifth plane planet, and back the Lords of Form go to the Solar Logos to repeat the same process. In the language of esoteric Masonry, the Lords of Form have the role of Hiram King of Tyre, who provided the raw materials for the building of the Temple.
Meanwhile the third of the three primal swarms is getting under way. When the Lords of Form move from the seventh plane to the sixth, another batch of seventh-plane atoms are drawn into the Planetary Spirit on that plane to form a new body for her, and like the Lords of Form, they take on the patterns already laid down, becoming individualized beings, building seventh-plane bodies, and entering into rapport with the Planetary Spirit. This third swarm has an easy time of it on each plane, since the atoms it forms into its bodies are already conditioned by having been part of the body of a Divine Spark. They finish their work faster than the first two swarms do, but they can’t move on until the swarm before them takes another step, so there they remain.
Those of my readers who have ever witnessed what happens with a room full of seven-year-olds who have nothing to do, or who remember how their own seven-year-old selves responded to such a situation, know what happens next. They start to play, and tolerably often, this means they get into trouble. That’s what happens to the third swarm. They get rambunctious with one another and with the Planetary Spirit, and the result is what Fortune calls epigenesis.
That’s a sufficiently important concept in The Cosmic Doctrine that it deserves a more complete description here. Epigenesis is what less careful philosophers call “free will.” Consider the way that trainers in aquariums teach seals to perform tricks. They don’t show them tricks and try to bully them into doing them; no, what they do is set things up so that the individual seals are rewarded randomly by a machine that spits out fish at unpredictable intervals. The seals, trying to figure this out, will repeat various things they were doing when the fish showed up. As the machine keeps reinforcing at random and the seals try harder and harder to make the thing cough up fish, they will work out various repetitive routines, many of which look cute to human beings. The trainer then starts deliberately reinforcing the cutest maneuvers, and the seals go on display, splashing about and balancing balls on their noses in the serene conviction that they’ve figured out how to get the humans to fork over the fish.
That’s epigenesis. Any time a being capable of action ends up in a setting that provides random or quasi-random responses to action, you get epigenesis. Each individual being responds differently to it, and so epigenesis leads to differentiation, and to the beginnings of personality. Over time, furthermore, as one layer of epigenesis overlays another, complex feedback loops form, so that this set of epigenetic behavior sets off that set, but only under conditions that don’t put a third set into action. As individual complexity increases, linear cause and effect dissolve into the kind of strange loops Douglas Hofstadter explored so colorfully in his book Gödel, Escher, Bach, producing the unpredictable, reflective, innovative behavior we call thinking.
The third of the three primal swarms are therefore the Lords of Mind. They are the first of the swarms to become fully individualized beings with their own distinct characters, because they are the first to go through epigenesis. The Lords of Flame lay down the basic patterns of existence, the Lords of Form provide the substance of existence, but the Lords of Mind elaborate, individualize, and create. In the metaphors of esoteric Masonry, where the Lords of Flame have the role of King Solomon, and the Lords of Form that of King Hiram, the Lords of Mind have the role of the third grand master, Hiram Abiff the widow’s son, who was responsible for the ornamentation, the metalwork, and the day-to-day construction of the Temple.
There’s a warning implied in that identification, though. As my brother Masons are well aware, and as other readers who know their way around Masonic symbolism also know, Masonic tradition has it that Hiram Abiff did not survive to see the Temple completed. Epigenesis need not result in increased complexity and the awakening of mind. As the metaphor of seven-year-olds left to their own devices suggests, it can also result in chaos and disintegration.
Fortune makes a profound comment on this distinction. Epigenesis, she says, is what happens when energies that are trying to continue in one direction are stymied, so that they play among themselves and develop new aspects and relationships. The technical term for this process is “sublimation.”  If the blockage of the energies continues too long, however, the process reverses and the energies revert to a more primitive mode of functioning; the technical term for this retrograde process is “degradation.”
In some of her other writings, Fortune uses the example of human sexuality to show the way that epigenesis starts with sublimation and ends with degradation. When children first reach puberty they are in no way ready for the intricacies of sexual relationships, and so healthy societies prevent them from pursuing their urges to their natural fulfillment. The result is sublimation: the sexual energies, prevented from finding the usual outlet, flow instead into other pursuits, such as creativity, spirituality, and personal maturation. Once these other pursuits have become stable enough, the child is a child no longer, and is ready to enter into sexual life. Keep the barrier in place thereafter, though, and you get all the neurotic consequences of enforced celibacy, which can be described neatly enough (and were in fact so described by Freud and his pupils) in terms of reversion to childhood stages that should have been long outgrown.
Degradation isn’t a risk for the Lords of Mind. They come into being in a solar system that is still simple enough, and strongly enough pervaded by the patterns set out by the Solar Logos, that they complete their epigenesis on each plane in perfect harmony, laying down patterns that will awaken thought and personality in the subsequent swarms. It is these subsequent swarms are the ones that run the risk of degradation if they remain too long in transitional stages, and of entering into modes of epigenesis that will take them out of balance with the rest of the solar system and send them spinning off on strange and self-destructive destinies of their own.
The second half of the building of the solar system, as the swarms reach the first plane and then begin the long ascent back to the Solar Logos, will be the subject of the next chapter, and of further chapters after that. The outward journey deserves close attention, though, because this is one of the places that Fortune’s great metaphor can be applied most obviously to the details of human life. Most of my readers, for example, will have had the opportunity to interact with organizations at various points in their growth and development. The three primal swarms are, among other things, the stages in that process of growth.
Perhaps, dear reader, you have had the experience of helping to found a new organization. You already know in a small way the work of the Lords of Flame: how much effort it takes to establish brand new patterns of action and communication, encourage members to use those and not bring in other patterns from elsewhere, and learn to think of themselves as members of a group rather than individuals who happen to be drifting through a given set of interactions.
Or perhaps, dear reader, you have joined a group that has already been established but is hitting its growth curve. You know in a small way the work of the Lords of Form: what it takes to gather adequate human material together and bring it into harmony with the existing structures of the organization, and how often you have to go back to the beginning and repeat a familiar process before everything works smoothly at last.
Or finally, dear reader, perhaps you have had the experience of joining a well-established organization, and finding that the work that is open to you is a matter of elaborating an existing structure and working out the subtle variations that make the guiding principles a little better suited to each of the situations it encounters. You thus know in a small way the work of the Lords of Mind.
The same metaphor can be applied in other ways, of course. The thing that matters, as you study The Cosmic Doctrine, is that you learn to apply the metaphors of the work yourself, to use them as tools for thinking, and make sense of your world in the distinctive way Fortune sketches out.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on October 9.  Until then, have at it!

I haven’t read your post yet, but I have read the chapter twice.  Before I read your comments, I want to say that this chapter was easier going; I was able to place the Lords of Flame and the Lords of Form easily on the tree.  The Lords of Mind, I was less certain about.  I’m looking forward to reading the post later today after I finish my “chores.”

In the solar system analogy presented here, the Solar Logos is the “Great Being” from which all things in the solar system emanate, and is presented as the end point of the cosmic atom’s journey. However, in other places in traditional occultism Solar Symbolism is used to describe the Lesser Countenance of that being, representing an important intermediary between the Supreme Being and the rest of the cosmos. Likewise, in traditional polytheism, solar deities are often than not the son of the supreme being rather than the supreme being himself. Beyond the convenience of the familiarity of the heliocentric solar system as an image, is there a deeper reason for her use of a Tiphareth symbol to express a Kether concept? Or is the overlapping symbolism just a trap for the overly rigid mind?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								September 11, 2019 at 2:00 pm							




Phutatorius, good. The Lords of Flame correspond to the Pillar of Force, the Lords of Form to the Pillar of Form. That leaves…  😉
Eric, no, the Solar Logos isn’t the endpoint of the Cosmic atom’s journey, it’s just as far ahead as Fortune shows us. In the terms you’re using, the Solar Logos of each solar system is its  Lesser Countenance, with the Central Sun of the Cosmos from which each Cosmic atom emanated as the Greater Countenance. Each Cosmic atom that travels out with the Solar Logos-to-be is a soul relating to the Lesser Countenance or solar god, and then completes that interaction and travels out into the wider cosmos to relate to the Central Sun as a traveling atom; meanwhile the Solar Logos, at the end of its cycle of creating and evolving a solar system, also goes on, to a destiny Fortune only indicates in hints. Does that make things clearer?

Hi JMG,
Thanks for these posts. I just picked up my copy of The Cosmic Doctrine a week or two ago and have started the reading and studying in the past few days, working off your first post in this series. I had two quick questions I hope you won’t mind answering.
First off, are these posts open for questions in relation to old chapters? Could I ask you a question if one arises as I work through the book behind where you are now (assuming it wasn’t asked and answered in the material’s original post), or do you want it to firmly stay with the current material?
Second, do you think it’s viable to move through the study a bit quicker than your original once a month schedule? I realize from what you’ve written that it’s important to read and study carefully, to go slowly, and to train my mind for the material. However, could something like going through each section two weeks at a time rather than a month at a time, moving on IF I feel like I have a good grasp of things (and not if I don’t)–would that work? Or do you recommend sticking with the original schedule and just remaining a year-plus behind?
Thanks so much! I’m already finding this project really intriguing and it’s bringing up some interesting personal questions.

This was a fairly straightforward chapter for me too. The only really difficult part is the exact mechanism of epigenesis making evil. It seems like it’s sort of just doing the wrong thing at the wrong place at the wrong time sort of thing, which is also not quite within the will of the atom. One too many bounced checks.
Anyway, another thing that tripped me up for a moment when reading your synopsis of the chapter was that the Arch Angels are more powerful than Gods! But thinking a bit, in one way they are, but in another way, since they don’t have free will, they aren’t! Also, it makes sense in this nested hierarchical Monotheism (is that the right word?) of Fortune, being a Christian. The Solar Logos is the True God (or rather, Son of God, since maybe the True God is the Cosmic Sun) and thus much more powerful than any of the beings in it’s solar system. 
Third thing, is Free Will then only possible within the Solar System? And since there is a tension between Cosmic Forces and Universal/Solar System forces, it seems like these Lords are building the possibly evil illusional world. I can easily flip this to the Gnostic idea of the Logos being a Demiurge and the Lords being Archons. It is in the Cosmos that the True Forms exist?
It is fun to play around with the metaphors, but there is a point where they don’t fit too.

I’m still trying to understand the nature of the atoms being generated in the solar system from Chapter 12, and I don’t think I’ll be able to catch up to the current discussion until I’m clearer on this process. 
What is the process that generates the new atoms in the solar system? In my meditations I came up with two possibilities. 
The first possibility is analogous to the generation of the Cosmic atoms. When the Solar Logos projects its concept of itself, that includes the formation and action of the Rays. The solar system Rays interpenetrate within the Solar Logos to form tangential movements that form vortices that group into various sided figures, just as happened to form the Cosmic atoms. If this is so, then presumably all the same sided atoms are possible, which drift out to the various planes when the Solar Logos projects out its reflection of the Cosmos. 
The second possibility is that while the Solar Logos is brooding, before it projects out what it integrated from its time as a traveling atom in the Cosmos, the Cosmic atoms it brought with it are moving around randomly. Their tracks in space could then interact tangentially and create atoms that have the imprint or reflection of Cosmic atoms as part of their pattern or repertoire of dance moves. The Solar Logos then organizes these atoms into planes when it project its understanding of itself.
Do either or both of these possibilities create the solar system atoms? Or is it by some other means that they are created? 
I’m also trying to understand why only seventh-plane atoms are involved in the process of creating the composite being consisting of the seed atom, its track in space, and the cloud of seventh plane atoms. 
I’m also trying to understand what it means to say that the seed atom “is a reflection, within the solar system, of a Cosmic atom which is the spiritual essence of that entity.” I seem to have missed how that happened, unless it has to do with the second of the two possibilities I asked about above.
Finally, I don’t understand why, in the solar system, the seventh plane is the closest plane to the Solar Logos whereas it is the farthest away from the Central Sun in the Cosmos. Is there some sort of symmetry involved, similar to the way that a mirror reverses right and left?
I may have more questions later, depending on how you answer these. Thank you for your patience and willingness to answer questions and to provide these commentaries!

Hi JMG, 
After spending quite a bit of time of googling  Lords of Flame and reading a lot of material I couldn’t really understand, you make it clear in two sentances . Thank you! I certainly appreciate your caution of summarizing too quickly but this gives a  structure to attach further information to as it comes along.
Regarding the answer you gave regarding the relationship between the Lords of Form and Force to the pillars of the tree, is there a similar relationship to be found in the Tarot?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								September 11, 2019 at 6:44 pm							




Joel, glad to hear it. You can certainly ask questions about earlier chapters, and the one chapter per month pace isn’t mandatory — it’s as much because that’s how much time I can afford to put into writing these as it is anything else. 
Isaac, hmm. Where do you get the idea that the text says archangels are more powerful than gods? The Lords of Flame comprise all the angelic hosts, from angels up to Cherubim, and they and the Lords of Form and Mind are all comprised within the terms that polytheists use for beings worthy of reverence — numina, kami, gods, and so on. As for evil, we’ll be covering that in much more detail later on; remember that in the metaphors of the Cos.Doc., eternal damnation is extremely rare and you have to work overtime to achieve it, but epigenesis leading to imbalances that have to be worked out by various combinations of grace and effort is a universal experience in our swarm of Divine Sparks; you could even use terms such as “fallen” to describe the result of unbalanced epigenesis, if your religious tradition prefers such labels. Yes, epigenesis only takes place within a solar system; as for the dualist Gnostic interpretation, to my mind that’s a misinterpretation, but of course it’s an easy one to fall into under certain circumstances (those that Steiner associates with the “Luciferic” end of evil). 
SLClaire, you may want to reread Chapter 9. The answer is your second option; the atoms of the solar system are brought into being by the repetitive movements of the Cosmic atoms in the period right after the Logos and the Cosmic atoms that accompany it have settled on the seventh Cosmic plane, while the Logos is still brooding over his experiences and has not yet begun structuring the solar system-to-be. Since an atom is simply a set of movements in space that have become locked into a repetitive form, the Cosmic atoms can create other atoms by their repetitive movements; the atoms thus created become the raw material of the solar system once the Logos gets to work on them — and each of those atoms remains connected to the Cosmic atom that created it, and serves as the Cosmic atom’s anchor in the secondary reality of the solar system. Does that help? 
Fortune doesn’t explain why the seventh plane in a solar system is closest to the center, while the seventh Cosmic plane is furthest from the Cosmic center. Nor does she explain why only the seventh plane atoms become the seed atoms of beings.  She just says that these are the case. Treat it as part of the metaphor…
Phutatorius, nah, within the solar system, they’re Tiphareth, because they’re the Great Initiators. I’d identify the Lords of Flame with Chesed and the Lords of Form with Geburah; then the Logos becomes Kether, the Cosmic atoms are Chokmah, and the tracks in space that become the solar system’s atoms are Binah; the Divine Sparks, the tracks of pure movement that echo the dance of the Logos and serve as the first rough sketch of mind to the beings of the solar system, are Daath. 
Zebby, glad to hear it. As for the relationship of the Pillars to the Tarot — or are you suggesting a relationship between the Lords of Flame and Form and the Tarot? — I’m going to toss that straight back to you. How would you trace such a relationship?

Please allow me to express how completely invaluable your walkthrough of Cosmic Doctrine has been, JMG.  Without it, there would not have been any hope at all of gleaning its knowledge, not even a little bit.
I’m a musician, so like the old saying goes, when you’re a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail.  I am reminded of the first tune I ever composed in my life, the horrifically annoying three-note pattern I called “Thunder Horse”.  I was four or five years old and it took two hands and Herculean amounts of thought-crunching to play those three notes.  I was a non-prodigy from a non-musical family.  
My Lord of Flame struggled to scrap those pathetic musical bits together, and the battle would be entirely uphill from there.  Similarly, when a student without any previous musical background comes to me for lessons, they have the huge barrier of developing the habit of practice once I show them how to play something about as difficult as Thunder Horse.  For guitar players, callouses must be developed on the tenderest part of the fingertips (ouch!) and that only happens one way: regular practice.
The Lord of Form was a cruel taskmaster when it came to turning a song into a finished product.  I had to return to the drawing board many times, not just scrapping countless hours of tunes or dismantling and re-combining them, but also learning harmony and eventually notation.  For my students, what comes to mind is the first recital.  That’s the one where you cry afterward and your leg/arms/body shakes so bad, you can barely pilot whatever instrument you are playing.  Been there, done that.
Perhaps the Lord of Mind showing up is the brief moment of solace when a song is finished and recorded, or when it is practiced enough to feel as comfortable as it is going to get.  For my student, perhaps it is enough mastery to teach a key concept of music to someone else while enjoying the process of learning and performing tunes for the rest of their lifetime, which to me is the best possible outcome.

“Work is Love made visible.” ~ Kahlil Gibran
It stands out how much work must be involved in all this business of creation. The Lords of Flame, Form & Mind appear to be working their tails off for the benefit of all of us. (I’m sensing there’s more to The Cosmic Doctrine than mere metaphorical imagery.)
I can’t imagine how much work our esteemed host, JMG, puts into his blog & books. I know how hard I work just to try & keep up with the all the challenges that life presents in my immediate surroundings. Perhaps it’s fair to say that in order to enjoy dancing the Cosmic Dance — & not be left behind or trampled upon by other blissed out dancers — one must embrace one’s work & duties wholeheartedly & without reservation.
A mentor of mine taught that “creative action is the Lord’s pleasure.” Work not only makes love visible, but it generates an inner pleasure, spiritual connectivity & stability… & if you’re fortunate, sometimes you’ll make a little money in the process! 😉

Well – this chapter’s a lot easier. Kind of feels like the ground I stand upon is no longer tossing and spinning about and after a tumultuous couple of chapters a somewhat familiar landscape appears before me… 
The parallels between the Lords of Flame / Lords of Form / Lords of Mind triad and the triad of Planetary Angel / Planetary Intelligence / Planetary Spirit (as described in your Art and Practice of Geomancy) – or at least 2/3 of a parallel – are apparent. But I don’t see how Planetary Spirit and Lords of Mind match. Looks like we are dealing with two different models (Dion doesn’t seem to have a concept of “mindless forces” in her cosmology). I’d like to know your thoughts on the matter.
On a different note – in case you haven’t seen this article, you’ll find that it has a familiar ring to it:

Hi JMG,
Are you going to go through any of Dion Fortune’s other books?  I have “Psychic Self-Defense,” which is my idea of an admirably no-[unDruidly word] set of instructions, and “Sane Occultism/What Is Occultism,” which, like G. K. Chesterton’s books, seems to contain many ideas that were common knowledge when it was written but aren’t so now.
Autocorrect wanted to call the Reverend Chesterton “G. K. Cheeto.”  😄😄😄😄. In a perverse way, I’m beginning to enjoy autocorrect.

Kimberly, you’re welcome, and thank you for the expansion of the metaphor! I know that learning to play on a keyboard, which I began doing after I turned 50, has been an extremely slow process; each step in coordinating my hands with each other took months. Then there was the process of bringing in material in the form of different patterns, rhythms, and sequences, and finally the ability to play a tune more or less clearly; I wouldn’t have thought of that in terms of the three primal swarms, but you’re quite correct that it fits.  
Sivadas, work for me is also lila, play — well, when it’s the kind of work I like to do, and fortunately I reached a point some time ago in my career that I can do the kind of work I like to do and still pay the bills! I sometimes think that the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind are also at play in the fields of the Solar Logos, so to speak; they like to dance, and their dancing brings worlds into being. 
Ron, they’re two different models using similar terms. That said, angels are angels and intelligences are intelligences; the Lords of Mind are certainly not mindless, and fill a different role in the structure of things. As for Iab Bogost’s article, thanks for this! If I had  spare copies of Retrotopia I’d mail him one. 
Your Kittenship, we’ll see what happens when I get to the end of the Cos.Doc! I haven’t yet settled on the next book, which is fine, since we’ve got more than a year to go.

Hi RonM,
We had a “magic potty” where I worked that would flush for 4-5 hours straight, creating a safety hazard because the echoing roar would keep anyone in the restroom from hearing the fire alarm (or anything else).  Maintenance would get the Loud Latrine settled down for a day or two and then it would resume the flush-a-rama.  One day I brought in a small spray bottle of holy water for a colleague to spray on her permanently FUBARed computer, as IT was out of things to try.  It helped.  Mostly in jest, we sprayed the Loud Latrine.
It stopped flushing immediately and never flushed again unless it was supposed to.  😳

Thanks, JMG.  I vote for “Sane Occultism,” as the other one’s pretty self-explanatory.

“entering into modes of epigenesis that will take them out of balance with the rest of the solar system and send them spinning off on strange and self-destructive destinies of their own”
I can’t think of any obvious and pressing examples of this process. May as well go check my Twitter feed.
Sarcasm aside, the process laid out in this chapter made me think of the creation of the world in Greek mythology, with its generations of gods, and their intermittent feuds with Gaia. Of course, in Fortune’s account the Lords of Flame, Form and Mind don’t seem to interact with each other, while the Greek gods take to civil war like Europeans take to soccer.

Where do the Qlippoth fit in this scheme? Theoretically they come from a universe of unbalanced force that existed before this one, or are they just left out of this scheme entirely?







 Isaac Salamander Hill says: 



								September 12, 2019 at 10:54 am							




Ah, thanks for the clarification. Yeah I guess I thought the Lords of Flame were more powerful than the Lords of Mind because it says in the text that they are “composed of the traveling atoms of the universe” and that is the first way that “it differs from its successor.” I guess I am also seeing the influences of the Cosmos as more pure, direct, True, than the influences of the Solar System.  But I see that this means the first swarm doesn’t really have free will or power of their own in a certain way.

Just a few thoughts on epigenesis: The group of seven year olds left to their own devices… well, that’s a couple of generations worth of the salary class that I will call the elite bourgeoisie.  These are the ones who have come to firmly believe they are the Good People as described in many JMG essays.  To them, the Progress narrative is still unquestionable.  They have not gotten over Clinton’s loss three years ago because they refuse to admit the reason she lost may be not be her unlikeable-ness, but theirs.  As we all know, they’ve become their own encapsulated bubble, and they are easy dupes for corporate interests.  I have an expat friend who is frequently baited into FB proselytizing for whatever cause du jour the mainstream media is pimping, like Amazon rainforest fires.  
Speaking of degradation: some Puritan once said idle minds are the devil’s playground.  Where would the elite bourgeoisie be and what would they be doing without their parents’ ample money?  Most of the elite bourgeoisie are neither self made nor independent of their parents wealth as adults, and yet these heirs and scions feel they are born to their family wealth and therefore owed it for putting up with the “suffering” of being born into rich, complicated families.  
They’ve been in their vacuum chamber too long, so they are turning on each other.  Toxicity is so bad, Joe Rogan laughed that they are eating their own like piranhas, the stronger ones sniffing the water for blood all the time.  Obama said the left will eat itself.

Every time I think about the triplicity/sequence of Flame, Form, and Mind, the metaphor seems more broadly applicable to all types and instances of origination and change. For instance, there’s an obvious parallel with the Unicorn, Phoenix, Dragon stages of cultural development. Biological evolution too: at the coarsest level, Flame is Precambrian (the slow origin of the fundamentals of respiration, photosynthesis, metabolism, and replication-with-variation), Form is Cambrian, and Mind is everything since. (But since there’s fractal similarity involved here, because of course there is, we can find similar stages when focusing in on e.g. evolution of land-dwelling life, vertebrate evolution, mammalian evolution and so forth.)
I don’t know about Solomon’s Temple, but every building I’ve seen constructed has gone through three distinct stages. After the “coming soon” sign goes up, there’s a first stage with little visible happening. (A pile of dirt gets dug up and then occasionally moved around; nearby curbs and sidewalks get ruined seemingly at random for no apparent purpose; sometimes a few workers arrive and stand around and stare.) This stage drags on long enough for rumors to start that the project has been abandoned. In the second stage, there’s a sudden flurry of activity and the building actually takes form in a surprisingly short period of time. Then, once the building appears completely finished, it sits seemingly abandoned again for months (this is while the interior is being fitted out) before it opens.
Shovel, hammer, and paintbrush. Every process I can think of, from gardens to computer programs to marriages, has comparable stages. And one reason this is important, as you hinted at with your analogy of organizations, is the value of knowing where the things in your life stand in that schema. If you show up with a shovel when the structure is ready for painting, you’ll be and feel out of place. Your efforts to build will be unproductive and/or your solutions to problems will fail. Likewise if you show up too soon with a paintbrush, the best you can hope for is someone will tell you, Stop! Hammer time! (Sorry.)
What I’m not having much success with so far is applying these metaphors back to understanding the point of the step by step details of DF’s narrative. When the Lords of Form go from the seventh and sixth planes to the fifth plane, then back to the Solar Logos, then do the Hokey Pokey and turn themselves about… it reminds me of trying to keep track of particle physics when a k-meson absorbs an omega muon and decays into a negative vogon or whatever. That part of it seems just a stream of facts and names with little coherence.

Re hammers and nails
Your music is my mathematics!  I have to work hard to not try to force everything into that particular wineskin, as I’ve discovered (that is, I’ve been told repeatedly, ignored that information, then proceeded to bash my head against the wall over and over again until it gradually sinks in) that reality does not necessarily map to that conceptualization.

Your Kittenship, I once cleared a perpetually backed-up drain with half a cup of Florida water. I’ve come to think that magical phenomena may play a much more extensive role in everyday life than even occultists suspect. As for variations in autism spectrum disorders, oh, granted — and there’s also the point that most people on the spectrum have other cerebral disorders on the side. I’ve got ADD and motor dyspraxia — the latter can be translated into English as “clumsy as frack” — and I suspect it’s that last that’s responsible for my very slow learning curve on keyboard instruments. 
Cliff, funny! We’ll get into the interactions between the swarms in a chapter or two. 
Peter, good. Did you catch Fortune’s reference to the way that degradation as a result of epigenesis pursued too long is the origin of some kinds of devil? Follow that out in meditation, with the traditional lore of the Qlippoth for comparison, and see where it gets you. 
Isaac, the Lords of Flame are more powerful than the Lords of Form, but both these swarms and the Lords of Mind are included in the category “gods,” if we’re using the language of polytheism. (So is the Logos, and so are the Planetary Spirits — remember that in a polytheist context, words such as numen, kami, and god simply mean “something that is appropriate for humans to reverence,” and cover a very broad range of beings that can be subdivided in various ways.) That’s the correction I was trying to make. From a polytheist standpoint, the Lords of Flame are gods, so saying “archangels are more powerful than gods” is a little like saying “sports cars are faster than automobiles”…
Kimberly, hah! Yes, that’s also a good subject for meditation along these lines. In fact, the trajectory of American liberalism from the New Deal to the present is a really good illustration of Fortune’s dictum about how epigenesis starts with sublimation and ends with degradation. The social revolution of the New Deal was focused on replacing liberty with equality as a basic guiding principle in American public life. To fulfill that process, the liberal managerial elite had to be willing to surrender some of the privileges that made it an elite — not right away, since that would have made it impossible to push through the changes they were trying to make, but later on, once the momentum of change was established. The Sixties and Seventies were the window of opportunity when they could have done that and embraced a more participatory society, having pushed sublimation of the drive for equality as far as it would go. When they clung all the more tightly to their privilege and turned against the working class Americans they’d formerly lionized, sublimation gave way to degradation, and the managerial elite began retrogressing, behaving more and more like spoiled children, until now we’ve had a three-year-long shrieking tantrum because they wanted a nice shiny President Hillary and the mean voters wouldn’t give it to them. Watch self-described liberals these days insisting that free speech is bad because it allows people to share ideas they don’t like, demanding absolute belief in whatever obvious absurdity the corporate media is pushing this week, or cheering on Antifa brownshirts as they beat up dissidents in the streets, and you’ve got a perfect model of the political endpoint of Fortune’s analysis. 
Walt, good! Those are all very solid interpretations of the metaphor. As to Fortune’s narrative, though, remember that it’s designed not to hand over everything it has to teach at once. There are meanings within meanings here, and it takes repeated efforts to watch the Lords of Form do the hokey pokey and meditate on it before some aspects of it become clear. In the meantime, if it’s giving you metaphors that help you make sense of your own experience, it’s doing its job. 
Your Kittenship, good. I figure it’ll be time to settle on a new title for the book club posts when we’re three or four months from the end of the Cos.Doc., but I’ll certainly keep Fortune’s other books in mind.
Yvonne, I note with some amusement that it was published five days after I posted my piece on the whole Chosen One business, and somehow managed not to mention where the author got her idea. Not the first time I’ve had that happen, but this was a good deal quicker than usual!

Thank you, Your Kittenship, for the fascinating and humorous story about the mindless “magic potty” and how holy water made it fall into line. Hmmm. Maybe we need to change the phrase “there’s something in the air” to “there’s something in the drains”. 😊
JMG – putting aside the superficial observation that the three swarms of Lords seem to be terribly inefficient (their work dissolving at regular intervals, requiring reconstruction – if I was their boss I’d have fired the whole lot!), I am reminded of reincarnation – where once we learn a particular skill or set of concepts in one life, we readily pick it up (or seem to already know it) in the next life. The only thing is that these Lords are not mortal, so the idea of reincarnation is not applied to them. Perhaps “we” are the raw material that the Lords are assembling and refining? Unfortunately, because our historical records over long periods being so patchy, it is hard to tell how true this phenomenon is at the species-level.

Dr Pales’ book has a list I checked to match with Fortune’s: He lists the Spirits of Love (Seraphim), Spirits of Harmony (Cherubim), Will (Thrones), Wisdom (Dominions), Movement (Virtues), Form (Power), Nations (Principalities), Time (Archangels), and Spirits Guarding Men (Angels). Not that they have to match exactly, but having come across lists like this before (in Steiner and Max Heindel, for instance), I am starting to realize that they are just different names for the same thing, or perhaps, a different aspect of the same thing, which is not a thing at all. But I really like “Lords of Flame”, a lot!

You say that the term universe refers to the solar system because we hadn’t discovered other galaxies. But we knew about this one and the word universe – doesn’t it sort of mean “all that is”? So it appears that the term cosmos does refer to the whole shebang, which back then was only one galaxy but still the term cosmos means all that is?

Can you elaborate on what Fortune means when she says: “Thus, the Planetary Being of the fifth plane would be an abstract mind; and the Planetary Being of the Earth is an etheric double.”
Is the earth in the fifth plane in this metaphor and are we a planet of abstract minds? I’m not sure I follow. Thanks

I had a shower thought this morning on the Lords and am wondering if it makes sense or if I am trying to shoehorn the metaphor into something that doesn’t fit.  Looking at this from mythology (I am going to use Greek because its the one I am most familiar with), I viewed the Titans as being like the Lords of Form, and the Gods and Goddess as Lords of Mind.   The Titans created the form and forces of the world, but the Gods were the ones who took over after them and represent more of the will and thought that goes into those forces.  Obviously, this isn’t a perfect fit for all of them, but it is something that I will be meditating on later as it seemed to fit decently well.

I took a long break from the Cosmic Doctrine to finish the Mystical Qabalah, it took me almost a year to read it. A long slog, but I loved it. I have 10 pages left – so maybe I’ll be done in two weeks 🙂 It definitely expanded my understanding of the Cosmic Doctrine. I wish I had taken notes, because as soon as I moved on to a new paragraph, I would forget what I read in the last one. Maybe when I do those path meditations. 
Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind
A mining scenario: The Lords of Flame are blasting through stone, going deeper and deeper, leaving rubble in their wake. The Lords of Form follow behind, setting tracks and taking cart after cart of rubble out, going a bit deeper each time. 
Once some space has been cleared, the Lords of Mind, the miners, come in and start extracting the resources. They get so much, that they are rich and they build nice houses, start families, take vacations, create art and culture, & give to charity. Over time they start to run out of resources and become more greedy, competitive, desperate, and fall into vices. Or perhaps they become so well adapted to their environment that everything becomes routine, free will is lost, until a new section of mine is cleared.
I just started raising chickens, how amazing is it that they can be raised by a human yet still know exactly how to be a chicken? I think a chicken still has some free will, but its a lot less than a human. I imagine as humans evolve over millennia, and we find a place of balance we will actually lose some of our free will and become more like other animals. We will return to the Garden of Eden. That might be considered de-evolultion, or maybe balance and stability is the necessary stage before overflowing to the next level.
The idea in the Cosmic Doctrine that there is a cosmic end goal has really bothered me. I’ve always felt there wasn’t, but now I am re-considering. I grew up with my dad saying something like, “if you are a bad person, you’ll get reincarnated as a fly and eat poop all day.” The idea that becoming a human is the pinnacle of reincarnation really bugs me, for one thing I think flies get a kick out of being annoying and eating poop. And actually that was one of the reasons I rejected paganism, because I felt humans were not above animals. The leader of the pagan group I was in was adamant that humans were on a higher level. For a similar reason, I was unwilling to believe in deities. The Cosmic Doctrine has gotten me to think about it differently. Now I’m trying to understand what part of my philosophy is influenced by Post-modernism (or the Technosphere?), in that all things are equal and meaningless, and whether I should try to root that out from my thinking.

Thanks everyone for your stimulating comments. I think another practical application of these chapters on creation and evolution is that they teach us the process of how to do the same in our own lives. When we really want to create something new, the first step is to create an archetypal pattern (the Lords of Flame), which is typically done through the processes of visualization and meditation on what it is we want. Then we move on and let the Universe bring that which we need into our lives (the Lords of Form). The Universe decides how the archetype will be formed. Finally, when the form comes into our lives, we must actually bring it into final form on the physical plane by taking whatever action is appropriate to bring the form into being (the Lords of Mind).
Thus, these three Lords are also metaphors for different levels of our consciousness, with the Lords of Mind being associated with that of our physical body while incarnation. In my own life, I have often started the process of creation from the bottom up, so to speak, and let my physical body try and create something new when no archetype or forms yet exists for what I want to accomplish. This has often resulted in failure to achieve my goals.
One last point is that it is important throughout life to keep working on new creative processes, to keep new archetypes active in our lives. This continual process of creation and evolution in one’s life helps one to avoid the process of disintegration taking over as we grow older.

Dion Fortune synopsizes The Cosmic Doctrine in the first chapters of her book The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage.  She briefly explains the difference between Black and White magic in terms that I believe will help all who are doing meditations on how epigenesis sometimes spawns the unbalanced forces, a.k.a. the Qlippoth.
“These seven planes, while all arising from the Unmanifest as First Cause, are conceived of as having immediate causal relations among themselves; thus the first plane to develop gives rise to the second and determines its manifestation, and the second to the third, and so on, down to the final plane of physical mater, which may be called the Plane of Effects, whereon the results of activities on the subtler planes may be observed and their consequences are finally reaped.  It will thus be seen that the esoteric scientist acquainted with the laws of one of the higher planes could control conditions on all planes lying below it, being in his turn controlled by anyone who was master of a plane superior to his own.  The final control is regarded as vested in the inherent nature of the Prime Manifestation.  
It is the aim of that branch of esoteric science which is popularly called Magic, to obtain control of conditions upon one plane by acting upon the forces of the plane immediately above it which acts as the causal plane to the lower one.  White Magic is distinguished as that exploitation of knowledge which aims at harmonizing and uplifting existence along the lines of advancing evolution, and which, though it may concentrate its efforts upon a particular point, excludes from its benefits nothing which by its nature is capable of receiving them.  Black Magic may be defined as that use of superior knowledge which endeavors to cause any section of existence to return to a phase of evolution below that to which it has attained, or which attempts to benefit any special section of manifestation at the expense of the rest.”  
Dion Fortune’s magical efforts to help end WWII is mentioned in light of demonic exorcism in The Exorcist’s Handbook by Josephine McCarthy.  The way I have come to see it is that Dion Fortune may have very well stopped a nuclear holocaust or other, equally nasty, Qlippothic demon-approved form of world-sized demise of destruction and devolution.  McCarthy does more than hint around that Fortune and her crew were effectively returning a great demonic warmongering force to the Abyss.  What degradations of the human race did Fortune help counteract and prevent?  I think it’s very possible that Fortune went to the luminous life-side after sacrificing her own body to cancer in order to halt the second “war to end all wars.”  Seems to me she would rectify any and all bad karma accumulated over time with such a heroic (yet so calmly and rationally executed in that epically British, stiff upper lip manner) and selfless act.  She truly was the greatest occultist of our time, or at least the 20th century.  We all strongly believe This Stuff Works; she actually knew How and Why.

Ah! Well thanks for the clarification to the clarification.

I went back to your commentaries from Chapter 9 through 12 and re-read them as well as your response in an attempt to better understand Fortune’s metaphor. I think a confusion between Cosmic planes and solar system planes may be at root. Let me lay out my best understanding in light of your response to my earlier comment.
Before it settled out into the 7th Cosmic plane, our traveling atom that became the Solar Logos attracted atoms of all the different kinds of Cosmic planes into its embrace. While the Solar Logos is meditating, these Cosmic atoms of all the different Cosmic planes finish their meditation on themselves and start dancing their tunes. Doing so, each also creates atoms that share in its dance (reflections of the spiritual essence of the Cosmic atom that danced it into being). 
This process is taking place on the 7th Cosmic plane, which is divided into the seven planes given in your diagram in the Chapter 14 commentary. As best I understand the metaphor, that means that the Cosmic atoms can create only atoms of the types allowed on the 7th Cosmic plane, no matter what sort of Cosmic atom it is a reflection of. So the dances of the different kinds of Cosmic atoms can only create seventh, sixth, fifth, and so forth plane atoms of the 7th Cosmic plane. Do I understand this correctly?
I was also confused about the numbering of the planes – I had thought the 7th plane of the solar system was the etheric/physical, but I see from the diagram that it’s the upper spiritual. That helps me with the part of Fortune’s metaphor where the seed atoms gather seventh plane atoms around themselves. They are metaphorically the lightest, so the easiest to attract when the seed atom has finished with its period of receiving the imprint of the Solar Logos during its traveling along the Rays. Then I can see where each succeeding kind of atom can be added during the swarming period: they are added in metaphorical weight order.
Also, the process of swarming that’s discussed in Chapter 13, the next chapter for me to work on, seems to be analogous to the Path of Descent in the Dolmen Arch cosmology, since the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind represent a working down the planes from upper spiritual  through upper mental in the terms of the diagram. Does this make sense?

Archdruid,
I was meditating on the ogham Nuin and its relationship to clarity, and I suddenly realized that the lords of Flame, Form, and Mind are a perfect metaphor for the power of words and non-words in magic. The lords of flame are the equivalent of thoughts/sensations, while the lords of form are the equivalent of the words used to describe the sensations, and the lords of mind are the meanings we give those words.
	Our senses gather up the stray atoms, the varied emanations of the solar logos, what we call reality. It is a greatly difficult task, and bring those emanations together builds our initial conception of “reality.” Our senses move far beyond our minds conscious ability to deal with reality. Out into the seventh plane, close to the solar logos.
	As our senses move out into the world, interacting and gathering up the emanations, our conscious mind goes to work naming and categorizing our sensory experiences. The lords of form essentially gather and name the very formless world, until they hit the point where the senses are no longer certain. Names become vague, and abstractions start to build on each other. The names of things are powerfully important in magic, because they give us a description of the borders of things and the ability to see and work beyond the borders.
	Finally, the lords of mind go to work by taking the words of sensations and begin arranging them into ideas and descriptions of reality. We being to create worlds through the stringing and arrangement of words, upon words. Until that too hits it’s limit. 
The eastern schools of magic seek to get closer to the solar logos by following retracting the steps of the lords of mind, to the lords of form, to the lords of flame. 
That’s about as far as I’ve gotten. 
Regards,
Varun

Ron, apparently the Solar Logos has his own hiring and firing standards. 😉 As for us, we’re one of the later swarms — by inference from details of Fortune’s model we haven’t gotten to yet, there have been at least fifteen swarms before ours. At this point the process seems to be working fairly smoothly. 
Your Kittenship, I could see it. My preference, though, would be:
******
Unlikely teenager: I am the Chosen One.
Old wise man: Okay, please take a number and have a seat in the waiting room — yeah, the one with all those other kids in it. Applications for shiny destinies will be processed in the order received…
*******
Arkansas, Dr. Pales is using the standard Christian ninefold hierarchy, reasonably enough. All those would be included among the Lords of Flame. By all means pick up the book — it’s well worth close study. 
Onething, the word “universe” literally means “that which turns as one.” Nowadays people use it to mean “all that is,” but that isn’t the meaning it had a century ago. 
Mike, no, she’s drawing a distinction between the planet on the fifth plane and the earth, which is on the first plane. The Planetary Spirit of our planet manifests herself to us most clearly on the etheric plane — the plane of the life force — but Fortune’s oversimplifying here to say that she’s primarily an etheric being; the activities of the three primal swarms see to it that all the planetary beings ultimately exist on all seven planes. 
Trubrujah, that makes sense. You could even identify Ouranos and Gaia, and the other beings of their generation, as the Lords of Flame; Kronos and the Titans as the Lords of Form; and the gods and goddesses of Olympus as the Lords of Mind. Definitely worth meditation!
Radha, well, I trust you’ll be reading The Mystical Qabalah again, so you can take notes then. That and The Cosmic Doctrine are Fortune’s two most important texts, and no question, they fit together closely. As for a cosmic end point, I don’t think that’s what Fortune had in mind — we have a long way to go beyond our current human level, and even when we proceed beyond that and enter into our Cosmic life, there needn’t be any stopping point. Keep in mind, too, that other swarms of souls have been through the same process ahead of us, and others are following behind us; we just happen to be at the human level at this period of the solar system’s history, going through the process like so many others before and after us. 
Dan, a good solid meditation on the three swarms! Thank you. 
Kimberly, that seems reasonable enough. The great thing is that Fortune spent a huge amount of time trying to pass on everything she knew to students, and the tradition she started remains a living current of Western esotericism. So those who desire to know how and why have something to work with…
Isaac, what a fine theme for meditation! 
SLClaire, excellent! Yes, exactly — and yes, what we’re talking about in this chapter is the Path of Descent; the return up the planes will be the subject of upcoming chapters. 
Onething, the “d” is deliberate. We’re talking about how certain kinds of malevolent and destructive entities come into being. 
Varun, that’s a very solid meditation on the theme. Thank you. 
It occurs to me that it’s been a while since I thanked the people who are following along on this adventure for their willingness to tackle so utterly unfashionable a work as The Cosmic Doctrine, and work hard at making sense of it. I appreciate you all — those who post questions and comments, and those who simply keep following along as best they can. Among other things, you’re all helping to lay down tracks in consciousness that will assist future students of this lore to make sense of it more quickly and thoroughly. Thank you all for your effort and enthusiasm!

The origins of free will in play struck me, and the case could be made that play is a less disciplined form of ceremonial magic, or ceremonial magic is a particularly complex form of play: imaginative play is one typical form it takes, which as the name suggests requires the sustained use of imagination. More advanced form of play also uses symbolism, by taking objects and making them into something else for the duration of the game. This is as true of imaginative play where the race car is treated as an actual car as it is for chess, where the pieces represent abstract things.
Magic also relies on memory and intentionallity: the latter can be shown to be key to play easily enough, if you’ve ever watched a group of kids arguing over what the rules of the game are. Depending on the game, a pencil can be a saber, laser, or just an ordinary pencil; likewise, the same pieces can be chess or checkers.
Memory is also key to effective play, since without it the game can’t work: the game can only work as long as everyone can agree of what everything is, which is only possible if the entire group can remember what has been decided.
The only thing which it seems to be lacking is ritual, but even then, some games (such as red rover) make use of what could be considered simple rituals.
What makes this fascinating is that one of the effects of sustained magical work is to awaken the innate capacity for freewill that we have as human beings, and develop the ability to be more than just an automaton. I think I need to take this as a theme for about a month worth of meditations….







 Robert Mathiesen says: 



								September 14, 2019 at 4:01 pm							




I totally agree with your take, Will J, on the close connection between magic and gaming.  I’m old enough that I missed the appearance of D&D and all its derived table-tops, let alone LARPs,  but my children and many of my students got deeply into them, and shared stories of their experiences with me.  My very best students in my university courses on magic were, almost without a single exception, avid gamers.
These games have brought about a seismic shift in the entire process of becoming an adult, at least in the US, with their emphasis on (as you point out) imagination, symbolism, memory and intention–to which I would add attention and ritual.  I consider the invention of this sort of gaming to be one of the few most important of all inventions of the 20th century, as important as the invention of computers.







 Isaac Salamander Hill says: 



								September 14, 2019 at 4:58 pm

In my thoughts, I was seeing the Lords of Flame as the elements, like air, water or earth, really primal kinds of things.  The Lords of Form would be hurricanes, water spouts, dust devils, rain, snow, streams, ocean, rocks, soil, gems, all the different forms the elements can take.  The Lords of Mind would be the creatures that lived in or used the elements.  In air it would be things like birds, insects, windmills; in water it would be fish, whales, boats; in the earth, it would be plants, earthquakes, hot springs.  Of course there is a lot of cross over from one element to another and things done by human ingenuity I think could count the Lords of Mind at work.  Does that seem on track with Fortunes metaphor?

Says Radha,
“Now I’m trying to understand what part of my philosophy is influenced by Post-modernism (or the Technosphere?), in that all things are equal and meaningless, and whether I should try to root that out from my thinking.”
An interesting line of inquiry. Certainly I find it uninspiring…what’s to look forward to if not growing in knowledge and wisdom through the aeons?
I also find that, paradoxically, it is not those who elevate humanity who think lowly of animals. Rather, those who insist humans are no different than the animals seem to lower humans more than elevate the animals.
To me, humans are quite obviously on another level than the other animals, though there are the elephants and dolphins to consider. But I have a very high opinion of animal intelligence. Their problem solving abilities at times rivals our own. At least, if you’ve seen some of those crow videos – I am chagrined to admit I am not sure I would have done as well!
But if you think humans and animals are on the same level, how far do you take it? Is a moth equal to a horse?
Human intelligence, though, is different. Animals are specialists, but we are generalists. A crow is excellent at being a crow and solving crow problems but humans are fascinated and curious about absolutely everything. And pursue it. When you think about it, that is a rather god-like attribute, because we are engaged with the whole cosmos. And our bodies match that, what with having free hands, opposable thumbs, good vision with upright posture. Our size is about right too. If we were very small, we wouldn’t have the strength to do things like metal working in forges with large fires.

Will, excellent. Yes, exactly; childhood play is how children begin to exercise their innate capacities for magic, and in sane societies, they then develop that further by way of culturally appropriate initiation rituals in adolescence, and education in adult magical practices thereafter. Ours isn’t a sane society, so we have to improvise a bit. 
Isaac, a good first step. Take it further. May I suggest the Timaeus as a helpful source of meditation fodder for comparisons? 
Kay, that strikes me as a useful metaphor for her metaphor.

“childhood play is how children begin to exercise their innate capacities for magic”
Reading this, I had the feeling of a huge puzzle piece slipping into place. I’ll have to do some meditating to trace out the implications. It may explain why I was so dedicated to daydreaming and make-believe as a child, even when I couldn’t explain why to anyone around me. 
Also, it can’t be a coincidence that in our magic-hating society, we’re replacing children’s play with video games. They’re very ritualistic, but in a way that diminishes the capabilities that Will J mentioned.
I agree with Robert Mathiesen about RPGs being an important invention. But I also think of a documentary I saw years ago, called The Dungeon Masters, which follows several people who are deep into RPG culture. At least one of the ‘main characters’ is seen to be using fantasy as a way to escape pressing emotional problems, and so resides in a state of arrested development. 
And this strikes me as an example of degradation, in Fortune’s sense. It’s not an inevitable consequence of playing RPGs or what have you, but I feel like it’s a particular danger in today’s culture.

Right now I’m thinking of the Lords of Flame as nwyfre, the Lords of Form as gwyar, and the Lords of Mind as calas.  For instance, there are some Chinese characters on a box of mooncakes I bought (Happy Belated Moon Festival, everyone!) and in the case of those characters, the Lords of Flame are the thoughts and origins of language that led to someone drawing the kanji, the Lords of Form who are the physical box and the brown and orange inks, and the Lords of Mind as part of the signal that compelled me and others to decide to buy the mooncakes.  I hope this makes sense.

@Onething
Yes, I did, for about 15 years, from the very early 1990s up to 2005, when I retired from Brown University (in Rhode Island).  One course was titled “Magic in the Middle Ages,” but was really a history of Western magic from Antiquity up through the 1500s, with a two-week unit at the end on how magic is (or seems to be) effective–in effect, on “How does TSW, anyway?”  The other was titled “Women, Magic and Power.”  It was a course on women-led magical religions in the US from the late 1700s down to about 1960.  
You can find and download the syllabi from 2004-2005 on my webpage at academia.edu, if you want to know the details.  Of course, now (fifteen years later) the reading lists would have to be updated to reflect the newest university-level scholarship on these subjects.  There has been an enormous amount of very solid scholarly research published on these subjects since 2005.  There is even a practitioner-friendly academic professional society devoted to them, the Societas Magica, which meets every May at the International Congress of Medieval Studies, held in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  (I had the honor of being one of the three founders of it, with Richard Kieckhefer and Claire Fanger.)

It’s getting interesting. (Grin).
I have only just read this week’s comments. I see Gnostic and Plato have already featured.
For me it is again the words that are deceptively common place and at the same time difficult. Both you and DF as ‘moderns’ can use ‘evolution’ and ‘primitive’ apparently conveying explanation: similarly ‘perfection’ equates with ‘harmony’. ‘Intelligence(s) equate with, I think, autonomous ‘minds’; ‘beings’, and so on.
I have been re-reading Kurt Randolph’s ‘Gnosis’ (English edition pbk especially pp. 70-72) in a little more depth recently (difficult). He equates ‘gnosis’, (or as I understand it, they also called it, ‘knowledge’), with our term ‘insight’.  I am drawn to thinking about ‘insight’ on the string of ‘planes’ (DF’s description).
For the Gnostics their god-given ‘insight’ brought them the ‘substance’ of ‘God’ on the ‘highest plane’ bringing with it an opportunity for ‘redemption’. Differently, according to my own and many others’ experiences, including famous accounts in the history of science, more ordinary ‘insight’ is a well-described experience. But insight even of the more ordinary kind clearly differs by ‘type’ depending on the ‘plane’ one is giving attention to. It can, a bit like Gnosis, feel ‘given’, without depending entirely or even much on previous experience.
The ‘substance’ experienced by ‘insight’ on the ‘highest plane’ might feel closer to God. Closer to home, very differently however, my ‘understanding / insight’ into a carburettor  (no previous experience),  on one memorable occasion after a professional mechanic  told me it could not be fixed, surprisingly got me and the family out of a difficult situation. Apparently, again differently and on a less material plane, I once saw the ‘good’ of a pleasant middle-aged lady. I speculated at the time this could be the kind of experience that underpinned the term as used by Plato. It would not have needed to depend on middle-aged ladies.
 I won’t go over the many famous sudden ‘insights’ or realisations in science. According to reports, these then usually took years of hard work to test and illustrate. Even I achieved one or two very modest realisations of this kind. I guess that on occasion one, usually inadvertently in my case, crosses a border, and is given, however briefly, an insight on the astral plane.
So far I do not end up with the Gnostics in a dualistic world of God’s substance/ Gnosis on one high plane, and a fallen world lumped in a heap with nasty history at the bottom. There still seems a long line between ‘here’ and ‘there’ and a long way to go. I proceed cautiously. Smile.
best
Phil H
PS Unlikely I know, but Yvonne’s report of another essay on ‘Chosen Ones’ could I suppose indicate an independent insight; a Wallace to your Darwin, as it were. Smile
PPS Re ‘games’, there is an extraordinary paper in the week’s Science on playing hide-and-seek with tame rats. I would love to share but would betray copyright. Don’t we all have interesting minds!

I can see that the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind are presented in this chapter as influences upon a set of stages, or phases, separated from one another in time.  However, I have been musing upon how their different influences weave together into a single moment of experience, each contributing an aspect to it.   
I should add that this musing is occurring within a larger context, which is my long term musing on autoimmune disease and boundaries, which is ongoing since I raised it here a few months ago.
I first thought about flame, and the way in which all flames every where seem  ever ready to be one flame. If you take a lit candle in either hand, and you bring their “bottom” ends together, you still see two candles, however you turn them. But if you bring the lit ends together, suddenly you see that there is one flame. It may still be fed by two sources, but it is one flame. 
So then I thought about form and realised that it is mainly a way to create boundaries, without which flame could never gain the perspective/experience of a particular time & place. A living being could be described as a flame separated out from All-Flame, by being contained within a bounded form. And within which it can discover by doing and reacting and being reacted to – the play of mind. 
I had already discovered some things about boundaries. 
One, they are maintained for so long as the natural destructive forces of entropy, and wear and tear, are kept at bay by the creative forces of repair and renewal. Both are continually at work. The Lord of Form is a creator and maintainer of boundaries. The Lord of Flame may be (among other things) a destroyer of boundaries and separations.
Two, boundaries must have both stoppings and crossings, to be effective.  To follow our current metaphor, the flame within must be kept separate enough from other flames to prevent it from following its natural inclination to dissolve barriers, unite with all other flames and forget “itself,” but it cannot be kept so hermetically sealed that it cannot be fed/fuelled and its ashes cannot be swept out.  So all sound boundaries include approved crossing places, called gateways, where substances can cross either in or out, following careful inspection by the gate-keepers, who are also boundary keepers. 
Thirdly, and this bears some relation to what Fortune says can result from the “play” of minds – the hazards are a) that flame can beat form and dissolve all boundaries, or b) that form can beat flame, by closing hermetically and choking off flame until it dies within. (I note in passing that both of these extreme temptations – open borders vs closed borders – are current in political discourse).  Ideally, flame and form balance one another and mind can play and learn.

The following comment is separate, being less topical – you may decide not to approve it. 
But in a different thread I saw someone ask if you had come up with a sense of what an “autoimmune” personality is (I paraphrase) and you replied you hadn’t, but not for want of trying given Sara’s experience. 
Anyway, the following may be of no use or help, and it certainly doesn’t address the “personality” question, but I thought it might interest some. 
So, anyway, as I’ve researched autoimmune diseases, I’ve realised that theories about how it comes about fall into two broad streams – each leading to almost diametrically opposed treatment principles. 
Most standard medical thinking falls into one of those streams, which holds that there is no pathogen present, but for some reason an immune system malfunctions, and begins to attack and sometimes destroy its own host’s tissue.  The obvious treatment principle in this case is to suppress or weaken immune function. 
Still within this stream of thinking, there is the nuanced version that is based on the insult/mimic theory, which holds that historical exposure (possibly only once) to a particular external stimulus (usually a foreign protein which has somehow bypassed all safeguards against it getting into the blood or the cells) prompts the immune system to react, and also mimics some protein that belongs to the body enough to misdirect immune attacks to tissues expressing that protein. This is often seen to be accompanied by allergies and intolerances, and the obvious treatment principle is avoidance of the mimic, and sometimes accompanying suppression of the immune system.
The second stream of thinking does not posit a malfunctioning immune system, but an underpowered or underequipped one.  This thinking posits the ongoing presence of a genuine hazard that the immune system properly recognises as such, but that it cannot successfully kill or clear. Instead it increases the power of its attacks on the genuine pathogen until the body’s own tissues suffer from  “friendly fire”.  Suspected pathogens in this scenario include heavy metals, non biodegrade able chemical toxins, moulds/fungi, parasites, and bacteria capable of entering and hiding inside cells.   The obvious treatment principles in this case are to assist the immune system to repel/clear the pathogen, and protect the body’s tissues. 
I think both kinds of thinking are likely to be correct in different cases, but the key thing is to choose the correct treatment principles accordingly and see what results. (The treatment principles are amenable to many different actual methods, IMO). 
In terms of our current political situation it may be that the first stream of thinking corresponds to the idea that our borders are too strongly policed, resulting in injury to people who are bit at all dissimilar to ourselves.  The second would correspond to the line of thinking that I’ve seen in some quarters, that the policing being applied is powerless against the actual dangers (some of which lie deep within, having evaded the gatekeepers). In any case, helping detect and clear the true dangers, while offering more protection to the body of the host would be the proposals being made there.

Well howdie. “Timeaus” wasn’t included in the collection of dialogues that I found at the local used book shop, but I did find it online. The similarities are so great that one could say “The Cosmic Doctrine” is a modern update of “Timeaus”… we even start with Plato telling us that this is a “likely story”, just as fortune tells us CD is to “train the mind, not to inform it.” There could, and should, probably be a book written comparing them, but to answer my own question, it seems that the Demiurge/Creator is the Solar Logos and looks to the Cosmos as the world of Forms from which to copy the Solar System. The “recepticle” is more like “the Unmanifest.” We see that we can apprehend the world of Forms with our mind, while the Unmanifest is beyond all grasping. I could, and shall, spend a lot more time in comparing these frameworks, but for now I’ll leave it at that and get back to work.

I’ve been dealing with an annoying blocked and ringing ear for the past little while that is really messing up my ability to concentrate and meditate, and so don’t feel as though I have very much to add to the discussion at the moment.  But here are my thoughts on this chapter for what they’re worth.
The ones that go before are blazing the trail and making things easier for those that follow along.  
I got to thinking about ancestors – the people who came before us, went through the whole process of living already, and are now teaching us who come after them.  
It’s usually easier to try doing something new if you’ve seen it done before.  Like how, for example, if your parents got you involved in gardening as a kid, you’d be more likely to take it up yourself as you got older, because the possibility of gardening was already present in your mind.  
In thinking about epigenesis, I got to thinking about how a parent tries to teach their kid the ins and outs of life, and how for a period of time the kid doesn’t exactly take all that advice to heart.  The kid wants to play around a bit, explore the world, learn the lessons for themselves oftentimes the hard way, not just obediently do whatever mom says (even though mom is ‘usually’ right with her advice!)  So the kid goes through their rebellious teenager phase and runs the definite risk of spiraling off in their own destructive direction, before (hopefully) getting on board with the process of maturation and taking on of responsibility, as the parent is keenly waiting for them to do.
In keeping with that train of thought, I wanted to say thank you to you too, JMG, for your work in blazing the trail through this ‘unfashionable’ text and making it easier for us to contemplate what you have already contemplated before us.

Cliff, no argument there. Video games are one of many attempts to colonize the childhood imagination for the sake of corporate profit; RPGs are more open — but you’re right that sublimation turns to degradation if the imagination is prevented too long from expressing itself in the world of actual experience. 
KImberly, indeed it does. 
Phil, of course it’s a possibility! If she insists that that’s what happened, I’m not going to make a fuss about it — but until that happens, well, we’ll see. 😉
Scotlyn, excellent! With regard to autoimmune diseases, Sara’s situation falls between the two models you’ve proposed. Her immune system went into overdrive when she was exposed for a lengthy period (without our being aware of it) to one of the toxic black molds that are all over the Pacific Northwest these days; all of a sudden a range of immune conditions she’d had in a very mild form, including allergies, went crazy on her; and her immune system has remained hyperactive ever since, though it seems to have calmed down very, very slowly since we left the maritime Northwest. I’m not entirely sure how you’d model that. 
Walt, in a certain sense, yes — playing D&D makes it less likely that you’ll buy into the fantastically narrow and hate-filled fanaticism Chick was pushing, and more likely that you might try a more participatory spirituality — “participatory spirituality” being, of course, a fancy name for magic…
Jeanne, funny! I like it. 
Isaac, in the Renaissance the Timaeus was generally considered one of Plato’s most important works; nowadays it’s very often swept under the rug, so I’m not surprised it wasn’t in the collection you found. Yes, it’s worth very close study, and yes, comparing it to the Cos.Doc. will take you in some fascinating directions. 
Stefania, sorry to hear it — may your ear get over its unfortunate bout of epigenesis and start behaving itself!

@JMG the proof of the model is in the testing.  These days, in the clinic, I’m starting to think that every diagnosis/pattern differentiation/model a practitioner comes up with (and practitioner can be interpreted widely – standard doctor, therapist, friend, mage) is a hypothesis which leads to a choice of treatment principles to be tested. If the model resembles the map (and it can only resemble it to a greater or lesser degree) there will be a result. For the practitioner, the important thing is, having chosen your treatment principles, to INTEND them as strongly as you can, using whatever tools you are trained to use. If your chosen intention is close to what’s needed, there WILL be a result.
Sara is very far from here, and I would not venture to be an absentee modeller, but questions that present themselves for asking would be – is there still validity in helping the immune system to clear retained moulds from the system? Is there still validity in invoking protection of “self-tissues” from “self-boundary-keepers”? If these (or other) treatment principles suggest themselves, I have no doubt the two of you know what to do with a clearly stated intention.

As an avid RPG gamer, I think what you get out of it is measured by what you put into it, in a way which is surprisingly relevant here, but basically they serve one of two purposes: they’re either a way to act on the world, or a way to act through the world.
I tend to GM, but the NPCs I create are tolerably often independent entities: a lot of the time they do what they want, and on more than one occasion I had an NPC who refused to do what I wanted and sent the plot off in a very different direction. That game was probably one of the best I’ve ever played though, so I’m happy with it.
Thus, my gaming tends very strongly towards acting through the world: using the world that the group creates as a way to express ourselves, but letting it exist independent of us. I also freaked out one of my groups by writing a thorough description of one of the areas another group had gone to, and then noting I hadn’t mentioned the symbol which all of them had found: that symbol was key to the plot and so the group which went there first had “burned it in” so to speak, and this suggests to me that the worlds have an existence separate from ours.
The part I find fascinating about it is that there are plenty of gamers who won’t allow their world the level of freedom which I give mine as a matter of course, and many of these gamers have problems with emotional development. GM guides lean towards this sort of play, and so I tend to read them and then toss them. They tend to suggest that if the players come up with a way around your plot, change the world to fit, where I always change the plot to fit the world.

Having caught up, *finally*, one of the things I like about this chapter in particular is the emphasis that each of the swarms has different challenges/benefits, and each of them (or at least the first three–does it continue down the line?) has a different purpose. It tracks with some of the input I’ve gotten during my moments of contact–basically “we need to be different sizes to work with different things/on different scales”, where all of those words are approximations of meaning–and also, I think, with some of the comments you’ve made about particular magical/mystical/etc paths not being for everyone in every incarnation. (Also with a hill I die on interpersonally: the concept that happiness/success doesn’t look the same for everyone*, or even for the same person at different points in their life.)
On RPGs, sort of similarly, my experience is that there are a number of gratifying and healthy ways to do them, from the beer-and-pretzels style that’s basically an excuse to hang out with friends and eat bad takeout to the deep immersion psychological games to weekend-long immersive LARPs (which everyone plays for different reasons myself, and I won’t claim that “wear a corset and impress cute guys with swordfighting skills” isn’t a major factor for me). And there are times when the ignoring-real-life aspect is helpful–my first year in college, my grandmother died right before a game, and it was nice to spend a weekend not thinking about it and inhabiting the head of someone who *knew* what happened to people after death–because hey, a crutch is great if you have a broken leg.
Thaaaat said, yeah, there are definitely unhealthy approaches. I can think of a couple people who absolutely *have* to play a game every weekend, and who publicly pressure game-runners for extra sessions and sequels to games that have just wrapped up, and they’re pretty inevitably people in awful marriages or jobs–which can admittedly be hard to act on, especially once “relationship” becomes “marriage and kids”, but still. And I absolutely know some people who use gaming as therapy, bringing all their personal issues to session and getting incensed when nobody else there is willing to act as an unpaid therapist. None of that is great for them, and more importantly–from my rather selfish perspective–it’s not fair to fellow players or game runners. 
Writing this out, it seems to tie into my recent attempts to meditate on Gamaliel from a casual-sex-positive perspective, so that may be a thing I need to ponder some more!
* “My parents like camping,” is my go-to example; a friend of mine, who sees more movies, uses “Some people *like* ‘The Matrix.'”

@Will J: That, I think, is the best way to do it, and I always admire my GMly friends who are good enough at improv and/or have planned the world out enough to manage it.
(I remember a college game wherein my PCs did something in the first session that basically got around what I’d intended to be the entire plot, and I was like “…oooookay I have to go to the bathroom. For half an hour. No I’m not frantically revising everything WHY DO YOU ASK?” 
These days, I tend to be more transparent: “Huh. Did not see that coming. Can we call it here and I’ll get back to you next session?”)

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Influences of the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind 
October 9, 2019October 9, 2019John Michael Greer52 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your seat belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 16, “The Influences of the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind,” pp. 76-79.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 17, “The Influences of the Regents upon the Globes,” pp. 104-106.
Commentary:
Last month’s commentary discussed the journey of the three primal swarms of Divine Sparks—the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind—from the Solar Logos through the seven planes of being to the material plane, forming planets and Planetary Spirits as they go. This month we’ll explore the return journey, which is equally important. On the way down, the three swarms had the job of learning how to function on each of the seven planes, building bodies for themselves out of the substance of each plane, and in the process creating the planets and ensouling them with their Planetary Spirits.
On the way back up, they have a new task waiting for them, because there are other swarms of Divine Sparks following them. In place of the raw atomic matter they dealt with on the descent, they now have to cope with swarms of conscious beings, less developed than they are but of the same general type. That begins the moment the Lords of Flame finish their work on the seventh globe and return to the sixth globe, because the sixth globe at that point is still inhabited by the Lords of Form, who are just getting started on their own work on that plane.
They’re just getting started, in turn, because of the distinctive way they descend the planes. As noted in the previous chapter, the Lords of Form don’t go down the planes in a single journey; they return to the Solar Logos between their experiences on each of the worlds, and then have to work their way back down to the next world in order. So they’re still traveling while the Lords of Flame are busy building the pattern of energetic stresses that forms the subtle body of the seventh globe, and they and the Lords of Flame thus end up inhabiting the sixth globe together.
The Lords of Flame, having already experienced the sixth globe, can perceive it as something separate from themselves—in the words of our text, they have objective consciousness, the state of which human waking consciousness is a first very rough draft—and so they can also perceive the Lords of Form at work on it. The Lords of Form don’t yet have that capacity. They perceive only their own internal states—in the words of our text, they have subjective consciousness, like the consciousness human beings have while dreaming. So the Lords of Form don’t perceive the higher evolution inhabiting the same world they do.
That lack of awareness, though, doesn’t equal a lack of effect. Dion Fortune uses an awkward bit of phrasing—“the impactation of a cyclic rhythm inducing a vibration”—for a phenomenon that’s utterly familiar to anyone who’s ever given a push to a child’s swing or set a cradle in motion. That gentle repeated push—the “cyclic rhythm”—sets the pushed object swinging. That’s what the presence of the Lords of Flame does to the Lords of Form; the bodies the Lords of Form are building vibrate to the beat of of the complex rhythm laid down by the Lords of Flame, and as a result the Lords of Form end up with capacities in that body that embody the experiences of the Lords of Flame as well as their own.
As the Lords of Form complete their evolution on the sixth globe, they become indirectly aware of the Lords of Flame; they haven’t yet awakened into objective consciousness, but they can begin to notice that something’s affecting the bodies they’ve just finished forming. Then the two swarms finish their work on the sixth globe; the Lords of Form go through the complex process described in the previous chapter, shedding their bodies to provide matter for the globe they’ve been on, and return to the Solar Logos to begin the journey down the planes one last time. The Lords of Flame, having finished their work on the sixth globe in the returning arc, move to the fifth globe—and the Lords of Mind, who have been waiting on the fifth globe, proceed at once to the now-vacant sixth globe.
Once they’re on the fifth globe, the Lords of Flame busy themselves with the evolutionary work they need to do there. On the way out, they built bodies of the matter of each plane, and absorbed the rhythms and capacities of that plane; now, on the way back, they have achieved objective consciousness, and so they have to learn how to perceive and work with the other things and beings on each plane, using the body of that plane as a vehicle. They also interact with the swarm of divine sparks that’s inhabiting that plane on the descending arc. The nature of that interaction varies from plane to plane and from swarm to swarm, but there’s a generic term for that entire class of interactions, and that term is “initiation.’ We’ll discuss that more a little further on.
It’s important to remember here that the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind are only the first three swarms—they’re not the only swarms. The same process that set them in motion set other swarms following the same route after them, and each of those following swarms follows the same pattern on the descent as the Lords of Mind: advancing to a new planet once the previous swarm moves on, busying itself with the work of its own evolution, finishing that up, and then waiting until it’s time to move further on. That waiting period is when epigenesis takes place—that’s the process, remember, through which random movements give rise to new capacities in the Divine Sparks, giving each of them their own individual characters and possibilities. The Lords of Flame and Form don’t engage in epigenesis, and so never become individuals. The Lords of Mind and those that come after them are individualized beings.
There’s a crucial difference between the Lords of Mind and the swarms that come after them, though. In the course of their evolutionary journey, the Lords of Mind never encounter another swarm further along than themselves. When they leave the fifth globe for the sixth, the Lords of Flame leave the sixth globe for the fifth, so they miss each other. Similarly, when the Lords of Form vacate the seventh globe on the return arc, heading back up the planes to the sixth, the Lords of Mind go from the sixth globe to the seventh to complete their outward arc. Once the Lords of Mind start back up the planes, they find the globes fully tenanted, and the next chapter will describe the work they do there as initiators of individual beings.
The beings that follow the Lords of Mind down the planes, though, encounter the three primal swarms on the way down, and are transformed by the encounter, receiving capacities for action and perception they would not be able to attain so quickly on their own. Again, this is the basic pattern of all initiation. The initiations that humans confer on other humans in magical lodges have the effects they do, according to Fortune’s metaphor, because they follow the “tracks in space” laid down by elder swarms of Divine Sparks as they interact with younger swarms.
The exact nature of these primal initiations, though, depends on which plane the younger swarm is on when it encounters each of the primal swarms. The process of descending the planes is, among other things, the process of building a body on each plane, and so whatever body your Divine Spark built while it interacted with the Lords of Flame is the body that resonates most closely with the primary forces of nature, because those forces were created and are commanded by the Lords of Flame. Similarly, whatever body your divine spark built while it interacted with the Lords of Form is the body that interacts most closely with the bodies of other Divine Sparks, since the Lords of Form created and command all bodies.
The Lords of Mind can’t be categorized so neatly. The first two primal swarms never individualize, and so they initiate the younger swarms collectively. The third swarm consists of individualized beings, and so its members seek out individuals of the younger swarms who are suited for whatever initiation each individual Lord of Mind has to pass on, and communicate that initiation to those Divine Sparks and to them alone. The younger Divine Sparks are still capable only of subjective consciousness; they become aware of their initiators only indirectly, and only at the point when they and the initiators are both ready to move on; but the initiations stay with the Divine Sparks, and when they awaken into objective consciousness on the seventh globe, those initiations enable the younger Divine Sparks to renew contact with the Lords of Mind in a fully conscious and intentional manner. (How that happens will be discussed at quite some length in later chapters.)
For now, let’s follow the three primal swarms back up the planes. On the way down, the task before them was to enter ever more completely into the planes of manifestation, to build bodies of each plane and to accept the limits of that plane in order to master its conditions and develop a corresponding set of capacities in themselves. They do all this in a state of subjective consciousness similar to the dream-state or, to use an even more appropriate metaphor, the state of consciousness of an unborn child in the womb.
Once they awaken to objective consciousness on the seventh globe, the task before the primal swarms—and every member of every subsequent swarm as well—is to let go of the limitations of each plane while retaining the capacities that those limits have developed. When this has been accomplished, the body corresponding to that plane falls away, but the capacity to form a temporary body of the matter of that plane remains. The Divine Spark then rises further and does the same thing on the next plane up. When the process completes itself on the upper spiritual plane, the plane of the first globe, the divine spark has become a fully individuated being, capable of ranging up and down the planes at will, and becoming embodied on any of them whenever this is convenient.
How that works, again, will be discussed at great length later on. For now, it’s useful to remember that the three primal swarms interact with the planets they dwell on in significantly different ways. The Lords of Flame, again, are the creators and masters of the forces of nature, and they interact with the Divine Sparks of each swarm collectively, giving an entire swarm certain capacities for mastering the forces of nature in their turn. The Lords of Form are the creators and masters of bodies, and they work on the substances of the planets rather than on the Divine Sparks who dwell there. The Lords of Mind, finally, are individuals and work with individual Divine Sparks, choosing those who can best respond to the initiations they have to offer, and thus contributing to the diversity and complexity of each of the later swarms.
Before we finish this chapter, it may be helpful to think about how you and I fit into this grand scheme. As human beings in the present cycle of our evolution, we are on the seventh globe, the globe of the etheric and physical plane, in the process of awakening from subjective to objective consciousness. (We’re still in the middle of that process, which is why we have to spend some time out of every twenty-four hours or so in subjective consciousness—that’s called “going to sleep”—and why so many of us have such a hard time thinking clearly about much of anything.)
All the Divine Sparks currently tenanting this globe belong to the same swarm we do; epigenesis being what it is, some of us are further ahead and some of us are further behind, which is why some souls became saints and masters in the distant past and others are still doing time as blue-green algae. All of us will work our way through the lessons of the etheric/physical plane in due time. Right now on the sixth globe, the globe of the lower astral plane, there are two more swarms, an older one getting ready to rise up to the fifth globe and a younger one waiting to take our place on the seventh once we finish our work here and rise up to the sixth, incalculably long ages from now.
You, dear reader, have received certain capacities for shaping the forces of nature from the Lords of Flame, but you share these capacities with every other member of our swarm of Divine Sparks. Your bodies—you have more than one of those, remember, because each globe has the substances of all the higher globes present in it—have been shaped by patterns impressed on the raw materials of this planet by the Lords of Form; these, too, you have in common with every other member of our swarm. Finally, long before you first entered into a material body, you received certain initiations from one or more of the Lords of Mind, and you do not share these with every other member of our swarm; your individual mind, as it awakens from subjective to objective consciousness, has certain capacities it shares with certain other minds in our swarm but not with all, and the specific set of capacities you have—the specific initiations you have received, and then went on to develop through epigenesis on your own—is unique to you.
That’s where you stand in Fortune’s great metaphor. In the chapters to come, the focus will shift from where we are and how we got here to where we go next, and how.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on November 13.  Until then, have at it!

This reminds me of a clock.
Over the course of six hours, the hour hand descends slowly from its pinnacle at twelve to the bottom at six.  Since clocks usually hang high on a wall or mantel, six o’clock is when the hand is closest to us and closest to the ground.  And over the course of the next six hours, it ascends back through the “planes” to the pinnacle again.
But, of course, it’s not the same time everywhere in the world.  It’s noon in Chicago but 10:00 in Seattle, 1:00 in New York, 6:00 in London, 8:00 in Moscow… the hour hands are all over the place, but all moving on the same conveyor.  If you use mean solar time instead of time zones, the minute hands would be too.
And now that I think about it, with a clock face you have 7 distinct levels, just as with the planes – 12 and 6 alone, then the pair of 11-1, 10-2, 9-3, 8-4, and 7-5.  Which also parallels the traditional astrological assignments of the planets – Sun and Moon alone, then a pair of signs for the other five.
…Maybe it’s not an accident we divided the day into 24 hours and not, say, 10, 20, or 60.

Off topic, but PG&E  turned off the power in part of CA because they are admitting they can’t guarantee they can supply power safely when both it’s dry and the wind is blowing. Pretty clear sign of the long descent. They can’t keep the lights on in the wealthiest State in the Union?  Will CS out of the cities become a Paid Avoidance Zone like in ‘Shockwave Rider’?

What this says to me is that cycles of reincarnation not only happen on our etheric/material plane, but also on the lower astral (globe 6) and most likely all the planes.  When Lords of Flame go to the Solar Logos, they are having a brief visit with the Creator before coming back to complete another spin on the globe, just like when people physically die and reincarnate.

Kimberley anticipated my comment it seemed. There seem to be ‘anchor points’ for the swarms, and whilst body shedding, such as at death, seems to be a ready practice, something appears to ensure that one then reincarnates back to that anchor point again, at least up until the point when the entire swarm moves on.
I am intrigued by the difference between individual spiritual development, such as reaching Gywnnffd, and the entire swarm development moving on. I suspect that Gwynnfdd in this context is more of an individual thing, as one chooses to take on a different body?

I also should have added that this helps,  a bit, to reconcile the Dzogchen teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. The Bardo Thodol speaks to the ground luminosity looming up right at the point of death. The ground luminosity is taught to be our true nature, empty and unchanging. However, this correlates more with the unmanifest, perhaps one gets a brief glimpse of it when moving between the planes? Or perhaps it’s a brief glimpse of the Logos? I havent quite got that sorted, it may not matter.

Last comment I promise! One thing I cant quite get my head around is the relationship between the physical planets as we see them, each of which has a planetary spirit, and of which I am assuming each planets spirit correlates roughly to a plane. Earths spirit correlates to the physical plane. How then do the physical bodies of the other planets embody themselves?

Barrigan, fascinating! You’re right about the clock; that makes a great visual image. 
Siliconguy, that’s been fascinating to watch. No question, the Long Descent is picking up speed, in a ponderous sort of way. I hope any of my readers who are still in California are either making plans to leave or are collapsing as fast as possible to avoid the rush. 
Kimberly, good. We’ll be getting to reincarnation a little later in the discussion. 
Peter, yes, the swarm stays on a globe until it’s finished with its work there, and you keep on being reborn on that globe until your swarm moves on, Remember, though, that our globe has all seven planes in it — the Lords of Form carried the raw material here from every one of the higher planes — and you can rise all the way to the upper spiritual plane on this globe. I’m not sure what to say about Dzogchen and the Bardo Thodol, as I haven’t studied the Tibetan tradition at all. As for the planets, though, remember that we’re still deep in metaphor here; each of the physical planets has a physical body, and planets other than earth are according to occult lore homes to evolutions entirely different than ours. The six higher globes in the metaphor aren’t physical planets…

Hi JMG
“…and you can rise all the way to the upper spiritual plane on this globe. ”
1. Does this mean that someone who achieves this must still travel back up all the planes?
2. And I assume this must mean ascending (far) beyond humanity?

1) “epigenesis being what it is, some of us are further ahead and some of us are further behind, which is why some souls became saints and masters in the distant past and others are still doing time as blue-green algae.”
I find this part difficult to understand, because it implies that eventually all souls become highly developed. I can’t imagine a world where humans and higher animals exist, but bacteria and green algae don’t, because the former depend on the latter. Or is there some collective leap in consciousness? That sounds like one of those New Age ideas of a world-changing or even world-ending event. 
2) And what is the quickest way to develop objective consciousness? Does it also mean I would never have to sleep again? For now I have to consort with the spirits of coffee beans and tea leaves to achieve that.  🙂

JMG,
I must say your Cosmic Doctrine essays are some of the most personally exciting for me of your long blogging career. So much of what you explain fills in gaps in my understanding of esoteric teachings I’ve studied over the years.
Here’s an interesting factoid if one wants to call it that to go with the Cosmic Doctrine teachings. Meher Baba says that in this physical cosmos there are only 3 planets that have humans (or species with all the capabilities that humans on this planet possess). The first has a human (human-ish?) species which is comprised of 100% head. The second is 75% head/25% heart. The third is our planet where humans are equally 50% head/50% heart. Furthermore Baba said incarnating on planet earth is required for anyone to advance to the next level. So I have no idea if he means at one time every human soul on this planet had prior iterations incarnating on those other two planets and ours is the final waystation before moving on to the next plane. But incarnating as a human at all is a rare occurrence for the cosmos. 
Baba’s book is so thick and intricate it will likely take me reading it 3-4 times to get what he meant by humans being split between head and heart. Perhaps it means logic vs. emotion? Or maybe it’s more between the dominant types of chi/prana in our species vs those of the other human(ids) on the other 2 planets. Regardless Baba kept driving the point that incarnating as a human is not optional in order to advance. Now as far as Baba’s use of cosmos I don’t know if he has cosmos equal to the entire universe as we call it today or if he simply uses cosmos where we use galaxy today. It’s possible he means the latter. If so that would mean there are 2 other planets somewhere in Milky Way galaxy that host species of equivalent advancement to earth humans.
On a second note today’s essay helped me better understand – there is a sub-section of Mahayana Buddhism called Pure Land Buddhism. One of the things it teaches is that throughout the cosmos are various “Pure Lands” that are (as one Buddhist sutra says) “formed from the merits and virtues” of the inhabitants that reside there. One Buddhist teacher (Sheng Yen) says each Pure Land is a galaxy system. Some of these galaxy systems are so far along (Amitabha’s Pure Land trillions of miles to the west of the Milky Way being one of the most famous) that no further significant transformations are necessary for it. Ours however is still very much a work-in-progress.
Of course Pure Land can and does also reference the state of one’s consciousness in many teachings. Vexations, etc becoming fewer and when they do one has better capability of dealing with them. But I wanted to share with you and other readers one reason why I like your Cosmic Doctrine essays so much. 
Thank you so much for taking the time to share them. And here’s my second reminder (vote) for you writing a book on the evolution of Consciousness much as Baba and Fortune have done but with terms, language, mind training that are easier for westerners to understand.

I have been reading Violet’s blog, and in her Sept 3d post “Divine Hierarchies and Human Vocation” she describes people who are devoted to Dieties or Principles, consciously or not, such as the sex worker in the influence of Aphrodite and so on. Is this what you mean by different Lords of Mind initiating different people? So the black smiths are initated by “Vulcan”, the poets by “Orpheus” and so on, or is it something else? It seems like all of life is “spiritual”, every facet is a direction for a soul to work on themselves. This would imply that from life to life souls refine what they have been working on in past lives, but also that influences can change through different initiations. Do you think most souls have one major Intiator or multiple?

Since the door was left ajar for an off topic comment, your observation regarding the Long Descent ponderously picking up the pace leads me to contemplate the impending Saturn/Pluto conjunction which will become exact in early January 2020. The conjunction happens in the US 2nd House (ruled by Saturn) precisely opposite the 8th House Mercury (ruler of the 7th). If it was Saturn alone that would still be quite potent but throw in Pluto and the intensity ramps way up. I’ve been in the midst of a deep dive looking at Pluto historically and it’s pretty significant in the US chart…the nation’s Pluto Return is coming in 2022, then the move into Aquarius in 2024. More and more I find I’m questioning your theory about its waning influence….guess we’ll see!







 CR Patino says: 



								October 10, 2019 at 12:31 pm							




Hopefully not too out of topic. This remainded me of a prayer my Great Grandmother was really enthusiastic about: the Trisagion.
At some point in the middle it… I dont want to say evoke because I ignore if that is the actual term, but… add your own voice to the voices of the angels, and it speaks of Three angelic hierarchies, each composed of Three Choirs.
Of the 3rd Choir, there are proper Angels,Archangels and Principalities. The first two do interact with individual people, but the Principalities only deal with collectives, – with Nations traditionally, but I suspect any organization with a well formed group identity does qualify. Lady Liberty, under this framework, would answer to all Americans, or to all Newyorkers, but probably not to all Yankees fans. Those seem to mirror the distinction between Lords of Mind and Lords of Form.
As for the Lords of Flame, the 2nd Choir do not interact with humans at all. Dominions, Powers and Virtues, they govern the Laws of Nature and keep the Universe and orderly place. Powers (Potestas) are granted special mention because they are the guides of the Planets in the sky (not of individual inhabitants of such planets), they also do battle and imprison demons, specially those capable of affecting physical matter.

								October 10, 2019 at 12:38 pm							




I’m finally caught up and reading the current chapter.
One thing that caught my attention from the comments on the previous chapter was when you inferred that there had been at least fifteen swarms before the one that we are part of. If I’m understanding it right, that means our swarm is at least another eight swarms past the seven swarms we are currently discussing. Is that what you meant? That implies that the process of creating swarms can go on for a very much longer time past our swarm. I’m curious if it’s possible to guess about how many years it takes for a swarm to go down and then up the planes – though maybe I’m pushing the metaphor too far.
When I meditated on the Lords of Flame and Lords of Form occupying the sixth globe together for awhile, I thought of what happened when I was away from home for a couple of months to help my mom a couple years ago. When I came back home, I had to get used to the routine again, plus the seasonal change from winter to spring, which meant a re-tuning into the land and what it needed from me at that point plus a re-tuning into my usual set of responsibilities.







 Versling says: 



								October 10, 2019 at 2:28 pm							




So given that our swarm, at some point, will experience some sort of collective ascension, could it be argued that all of the people betting on that ascension happening NOW to solve our current predicaments are a bit like Malthus?
The prediction is RIGHT but it is very EARLY.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								October 10, 2019 at 4:03 pm							




Shadow_rider, yes, a soul like that would proceed back up the planes with the rest of its swarm, but remember the role of epigenesis — that soul would have the opportunity to become something really astonishing in the process. As for ascending beyond humanity, all of us are going to do that; humanity is a way station, not an endpoint. (Or, in Nietzsche’s phrasing, humanity is a bridge to the Overman.) 
Nothing Special, you’re welcome and thank you. Remember that you can ask questions about earlier chapters if that would help! 
Legal Alien, 1) Fortune doesn’t cover the details of the transition that happens when one swarm leaves a globe and another swarm arrives. If the process extends over a few million years, say — an eyeblink in planetary time — the incoming swarm could fill the ecological niches that the outgoing swarm vacates. 2) The quickest way to achieve objective consciousness is the one you’re engaged in right now — being an incarnate being on a globe on the densest of the planes. It’s not a quick process. 
Happypandatao, thanks for this! I’ve been mulling over the prospect of writing at least one (and probably several) serious books on occult philosophy, covering the evolution of souls and the rest of it; the support I’m getting now from subscribers and patrons of my mundane astrology project is substantial enough that I can seriously consider a project like that, which is well worth doing but won’t pay the bills.







 Oleg S. says: 



								October 10, 2019 at 8:31 pm							




Is it the contact with Unmanifest (the Limitation?) that forces Lords of Flame to turn back and gain objective conciousness?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								October 10, 2019 at 11:04 pm							




Isaac, yes, I think that that’s what Fortune is talking about. As for whether most people have one initiator or several on the descending arc, good question — I don’t know. 
Jim, we will indeed see. Keep in mind that December 2020 also sees one of the really big conjunctions in traditional mundane astrology — a Grand Mutation, the passage of the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction cycle from one element to another. That ends a cycle that began in 1842 and begins one that will continue until 2219, with major changes to be expected — for the US among others, as the Grand Mutation is in the 10th house, thus angular and in the house that rules government, in its Washington DC chart. That’s the conjunction I have my eyes on! 
CR, interesting. If I understand Fortune correctly, all nine angelic choirs belong to the class of beings she calls Lords of Flame, and are differentiated according to function — angels to guard and guide individual souls, archangels to work with the church and its sacraments, Principalities to guard and guide nations and other large groups, and so on up to Thrones, Seraphim, and Cherubim, who contemplate God and, like prisms, refract the divine power down the planes, stepping it down so that the lower choirs can work with it — but of course your tradition is different and your angelic mileage may vary. 😉
SLClaire, I have no idea how much time we’re talking about, other than that it’s probably measured in geological epochs at least. The reason I speculated that we’re swarm 16 or later is that, as we’ll discuss in the next couple of chapters, the first three swarms have all already completed the trip down and back up to the Solar Logos, and so their relationship with later swarms and the Logos has changed in ways Fortune covers in some detail. Yes, that means there are probably lots more swarms still to come; it also means that we’re nothing special in the great scheme of things — just one more bunch of Divine Sparks waking up into objective consciousness, making a mess of it as usual, and slowly straightening things out. 
Versling, it’s not really a collective ascension in the sense the people talking about that nowadays have in mind. It’s not going to solve all our problems and take us to a happy place where we get everything we want — wheee! Quite the contrary, it will take us from a world where we’ve finally sorted things out and have things more or less moving the way they should, to a world where we have absolutely no idea what we’re doing and have to start from scratch to figure things out — not to mention figure ourselves out. So they’re not just early — they’ve gotten things entirely bass ackward. 
Oleg, Fortune doesn’t say, but that seems plausible enough given the structure of ideas she’s set up.

Oh yes, I’m all over the Grand Mutation as well…there’s no question that will mark a major shift. So you’ve cast basically an ingress chart using Washington DC and the exact time of the conjunction?
I’m still finding my way around the mundane sphere but I sense the Jupiter/Saturn cycle is of paramount importance in the affairs of nations. In the US natal chart the meet up will occur in the 2nd house. These are, of course, the classic visible boundary planets of antiquity. Also of interest for these times, the US had a progressed lunar return this past year and is moving now toward a new moon conjunction with the Sun in 2021…all in the 3rd house. So many layers…no matter how you slice it, there’s a whole lotta shaking’ goin’ on in the US!
If you prefer not to put this comment through I’ll understand…this conversation belongs on the new subscription blog, which I’m very enthused about. I’ve recently been imagining you as a 21st century Manly Palmer Hall, which I trust you will take as a high praise. Thanks for all you do.

Two questions for this month:
1: Up until this point I’ve been thinking of the Lords of Flame and the Lords of Form as being much more advanced versions of the divine sparks in other swarms that had already undergone a full cycle of evolution and become fully individuated in a previous solar system’s cycle. However, in saying that they never undergo Epigenesis and thus never become individualized, that wouldn’t be the case. Since a more advanced form of being would have already undergone Epigenesis in a distant past and would have become fully individualized on a previous journey up and down the planes. Are these first two swarms then “unfallen” in the sense that they have never undergone the process that leads to individuation? If so, do they have the capacity to do so?
2: Something about this week’s passage makes me think a lot about some of the traditional occult lore surrounding elementals, I.E. that they have not, as yet begun the process of individuation and belong to a younger point in spiritual evolution than us, under the guidance of the elemental kings who belong to a more advanced ones. Is this one potential way of thinking of the two swarms on the sixth plane, one preparing for manifestation on the seventh, and one preparing for ascension to the fifth and acting as initiators to the younger swarm?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								October 11, 2019 at 11:18 am							




Jim, I’m still trying to figure out how to use all the features on the subscription services, and if there’s a comments forum attached to either of them I haven’t found it yet. (Tech is not my strong suit.) So here is as good as anywhere. Yes, conjunction charts are cast just like ingress charts for the purposes of political astrology — that way you know which houses the planets are in, and so can figure out which aspects of political life the conjunction and the other planets will affect. I think, btw, that the importance of the Jupier-Saturn cycle is more than just that they were the outermost planets known to the ancients; Uranus and Neptune, hugely important as they are, represent (as I see it) primal forces almost too abstract to enter fully into time; on the Tree of Life, they represent Chokmah and Kether respectively — while Saturn as Binah is the lord of time, the first power to fully enter into temporality, as Jupiter/Chesed is the lord of place (as distinct from boundless space, which is Chokmah/Uranus). So the role of Saturn and Jupiter as the Chronocrators, the Lords of Time, isn’t misplaced. 
Eric, 1) “advanced” is a tricky word, as it presupposes that you know which way is forward! The Lords of Flame and Form are perfect as they are; they represent the complete fulfillment of two modes of existence of Divine Sparks, neither of which involves individualization as we know it. As for “fallen” and “unfallen,” that depends very much what you mean by those terms; they have descended all the way into physical matter and experienced its limitations and burdens, awakening into objective consciousness through that experience — but neither swarm has experienced positive evil except as an outside force to be striven against. It’s when you get epigenesis that you have the capacity for positive evil. 
2) Excellent! Yes, exactly.







 Onething says: 



								October 11, 2019 at 12:01 pm							




“The beings that follow the Lords of Mind down the planes, though, encounter the three primal swarms on the way down, and are transformed by the encounter, receiving capacities for action and perception they would not be able to attain so quickly on their own. Again, this is the basic pattern of all initiation. The initiations that humans confer on other humans in magical lodges have the effects they do, according to Fortune’s metaphor, because they follow the “tracks in space” laid down by elder swarms of Divine Sparks as they interact with younger swarms.”
How do you think the above relates to what Rupert Sheldrake has written about animals learning new knowledge quicker after an initial group has learned something for the first time?
“Similarly, whatever body your divine spark built while it interacted with the Lords of Form is the body that interacts most closely with the bodies of other Divine Sparks, since the Lords of Form created and command all bodies.”
Well! I guess that solves the evolutionary question of who designed the life forms.

It’s when you get epigenesis that you have the capacity for positive evil.
I suppose to state the question more precisely, do the atoms contained within those swarms, having never undergone Epigenesis, have the capacity to become disentangled from their swarms or fall behind, get caught up in a subsequent swarm and undergo the process that leads to epigenesis, thus losing their state of perfection but opening up the other possibilities? Or do those atoms stay in that same swarm eternally, always filling the same role in every newborn solar system?

I am wondering how the concepts of the last two chapters apply to our own bodies, since we are the microcosm. Many traditions have a correspondence between the planets and our various organs. One such system can be found here. If each of the planetary spheres are at a different phase of evolution as described in this chapter, that would imply that each of our organs may also be at a different state of evolution corresponding to the planetary sphere that they belong to. 
Another possibility is that rather than our organs being at different phases of evolution, they each have a specific planet that is their initiator. The days of the weeks and the planetary hours that correspond to each planet/organ would be the times that each would be especially susceptible to the influence of a planetary orb. Disease could also be described as the process of epigenesis run wild in an organ.
Since our heart is the solar organ, it is the Central Stillness. The circulating blood, then, is a swarm of Divine Sparks that leave the heart and pass through each planet as they flow from organ to organ. This rhythm of blood flow may be the shortest evolutionary cycle we experience. I think that taking time to meditate on the wisdom of the heart then truly does influence our whole body; because such moments, through their influence on the blood passing through the heart, brings our whole being into harmony, and epigenesis does not run wild.

JMG & all
I am still toddling along with words.
As you say ‘deep in metaphor’.
I keep pondering on this.
Initially I asked (myself?) ‘Metaphor of/for what’?
Perhaps this kind of metaphor is indefinable and more like ‘suggestion’ than ‘explanation’?
Which seems a way to sidle up to the realities of ‘being’?
I have had my doubts for over 40 years about ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’. I kind of reject ‘objective’ as a category, except perhaps where it involves ‘recognition’. I guess humans and a lot of others need subjective recognition in order, among other things, to communicate. It is curious how framing ‘recognition’ can make all kinds of realities, and others, talk back. Or so it seems.

Thanks for this. I’m not conversant in the Tree of Life system, but I think your sense about the abstraction factor with the outer planets (Pluto too!😉) is very relevant . What were the planetary signifiers of Chokmah and Kether before 1781 and 1846? Do you own Liz Greene’s book Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil? It’s a very fine work and my edition (from the 80s) has a wonderful old etching depicting of Saturn Lord of Time on the cover. I do hope you’ll be able to field comments once the new blog is up, seems kind of essential.

I think Nisaba (pronounced KNEE-sah-bah) would qualify as an anthropomorphized Lord of Mind / initiator. (I have been somewhat obsessed with her for a while now.)  Here is a good article on this ancient Sumerian goddess:
https://www.ancient.eu/Nisaba/
“Nisaba became the goddess of literacy and patroness of the craft of writing. Scribal school tablets often end with the phrase, ‘Praise be to Nisaba!’ and Meador notes how “a young student wrote on one ancient tablet, ‘I am the creation of Nisaba.'”
“When she had been goddess of grains, she was represented in cuneiform as a grain stalk, which meant she was the grain itself. Each early pictogram represented the thing itself, not concepts about an object or person, and so when the stalk of grain appears in early cuneiform the writer is saying Nisaba is present in that grain. In the same way, when she became goddess of writing, she was the written word; she was language; she was literacy; she was communication, learning; she was the writer and the written word.”
“The Lady – in the place where she approaches there is writing”
Imagine a ritual similar to a Catholic mass, in which the deity addressed is Nisaba, the priestess a writer embodying her, the congregation readers lending their energy to the priestess engaged in the ritual act of writing some sacred text and sometimes participating by writing also, the altar boys representing publishers, bookstore owners and librarians. The goddess comes down not in the transmutation of the bread and wine, but in the act of writing, which the congregants consume, taking into themselves the sacred words as though it were the communion host, feeding their minds and spirits.  All the artifacts of physical books and writing are religious objects in the service of the goddess. 
To read is to participate in a  ritual.

This seems like a really exciting chapter when I think of the implications:
1) Does our place here on the seventh plane mean we have had initiations from one or more of the Lords of Mind on the other planes or even in a different incarnation on this plane?  If so, those of drawn to study the Cosmic Doctrine with you may have had an initiation at some point that helped us to end up here.  And the Lords of Mind that resonate with us can help us reach our potential sooner than we may have otherwise.  It also seems to imply that there are many different ways to reach potential depending on which Lords of Mind have given us initiations.  I’m still brooding on what this means of the Christian spiritual path I followed early in life versus the one I am on now that is influenced by Druidry and ritual magic.  It seems as if the might be part of the same path that has pushed me to where I am now.
2) Just because we may be at different places in our development does not make us better than others around us in our same swarm.  But it does seem to imply that those who are further along than we are can help us and we in our turn can help those who are coming along around us.
3) Because our swarm has been influenced together by the Lords of Flame and the Lords of Form gives us a touchstone with each other despite our differing influences by the Lords of Mind.
I still have a lot to unpack from these last two chapters.  Glad to have the time to meditate more on this over the next month.

I just have a couple of thoughts so far from this month’s chapter. There are beings of other swarms of which we are not normally aware, but who are aware of us and influencing us by their particular type of vibration – their thought patterns or state of consciousness. We don’t have to ‘go it alone’; there are many other beings present in the universe with us, and some of them are even trying to guide us along the way.  Of course it’s not all rainbows and unicorns – some of the other entities are likely not concerned with us or even malicious towards us, but there would seem to be some that are interested in our evolution.
Since we haven’t quite built up the necessary bodies/states of consciousness to be able to be objectively aware of the rest of the universe, the entities from the further advanced swarms can initially only carry out their work of initiation by communicating with us through our dreams, and by occasional glimmers into the mind of our waking consciousness.  I bet many people have had those dreams that are more than a dream, where it seems an entity is clearly trying to communicate something specific and personally significant, or had the experience of thoughts that come into one’s mind that seem to originate from somewhere else.   
Traces and trails that point us in the direction of evolution can also be found in particular books, paintings and other works of art created by humans further along in the process of evolution.

Onething, I’m pretty sure that Sheldrake has studied Fortune’s material and simply hasn’t made that public, knowing how the scientists would flip. His concepts are basically identical to hers — and his books make good companions to The Cosmic Doctrine. 
Eric, er, I think you’ve misunderstood the entire thrust of Fortune’s scheme, No Divine Spark remains anywhere eternally, and the Divine Sparks that shape one solar system don’t go on to another solar system in the same role — where did you get the idea that they did? I’d encourage you to reread Chapter 14, where all of this is covered in detail. 
Onething, I announced it over on my Dreamwidth journal — you can find a link here to the latest update. By all means use SubscribeStar if you prefer it; I have both so that people can choose for themselves. 
Dan, fascinating. That sort of anatomical symbolism used to be very popular in the early 20th century but I haven’t seen any recent occult literature that uses it; still, it would be worth exploring. 
Onething, that was covered in detail in last month’s post, which is worth a second read. Yes, the Lords of Flame and Form achieve objective consciousness — you can do that without becoming individualized. 
Your Kittenship, no, probably not. 
Phil H, you can use “waking” and “dreaming” if you prefer. The difference is simply that in what Fortune calls “objective consciousness,” you’ve got the subject-object dichotomy in place, and perceive yourself and the objects of your awareness as different, while in what she calls “subjective consciousness,” you’re only aware of your own mental states, not of yourself as a being or of objects as separate from you. 
Jim, Chokmah and Kether didn’t have planetary equivalents before those two planets were discovered; they were assigned awkwardly to the fixed stars and the primum mobile, the hypothetical source of movement out beyond the stars. The discovery of the planets really helped with the symbolism. As for Greene’s book, I’ve read it but it’s been a long time; no, I don’t own a copy. 
Miriam, if Fortune’s metaphor is correct, all of those powers we call gods are Lords of Flame, Form, or Mind: the Lords of Flame are the celestial gods, the Lords of Form the chthonic gods, and the Lords of Mind the culture-bearing gods. Thus you may well be correct!
Cat, excellent! Yes, exactly. My take, certainly, is that every Divine Spark receives at least one initiation from at least one Lord of Mind on the way down the planes, and probably all of us got various initiations en route — as we’ll see in next month’s chapter, all of the three primal swarms range up and down the planes at this stage of the solar system’s history, doing their work. Yes, if occult tradition is to be given any credence, there have been a lot of initiations being passed on to a lot of people in past ages of humanity, so your chance of having received one or more of those in previous lives on this globe is pretty good. And your other two points are of course spot on as well. 
Stefania, yes, exactly. All very much the case.

Re objective v/v subjective:
You wrote: “Phil H, you can use “waking” and “dreaming” if you prefer.  …”
Thanks for that. Yes, I have tried that for a good while now and it works up to a point. The dream / awake dichotomy is useful enough in a metaphorical account / narrative. And in life, ‘waking’ brings all its useful correctives to inner being. But ‘thoughts’ even in the light of day are by no means necessarily ‘awake’. hmm …. 
If I may … Sheldrake …. He seems to observe that in some indefinable way, a palimpsest of autonomously-made decisions communicates and becomes a collective ‘objective’ experience – and leaves a sustained track for a dynamic we call learning. Not just in ‘animals’ it seems. I have wondered for example about fairly obvious British driving improvement this last 60 years as successive generations took to the novelty of the increasingly affordable car. I daresay, however, in much ‘development’ a lot is lost as well as gained of previous ‘learning tracks’, or veers off into the badlands.

I was curious about Pluto’s association and found this at kabbalahsociety.org: “Pluto, with an orbital inclination of seventeen degrees to the ecliptic, hardly belongs to the solar system, according to Halevi, and therefore corresponds to Da’at, which forms an access point to the next highest world.” Fascinating…so much to learn and so little time!

Hi John Michael,
I do sometimes wonder if the Lords of Flame or Mind, or even the Divine Sparks themselves sometimes feel (or express) as if in the past intellectual and/or spiritual giants had once trod upon the Earth?
Which leads me to my question: I’m curious as to how entropy fits into this metaphor? The inverted bell shaped curve is represented in an inordinate number of natural cycles, but perhaps this is purely a manifestation of the physical plane? Dunno, but something is tickling away at my mind about that subject and I am curious to learn your thoughts.
Hope it is not too cold up your way? At the moment the climate in this little corner of the continent is quite pleasant – elsewhere things are not so good. I’m preparing the farm for the rapidly approaching growing season. Thanks for the Monday reply too, and clearly the story is large and the telling is important. I’m cogitating upon the matter.
Cheers
Chris

I went back and re-read all the relevant chapters to this point to try to trace where my line’s getting tangled:
Dion Fortune earlier says that “It is the goal of every reflected atom in the universe to develop a divine spark, to complete the evolution from the human to the Divine in a reflected universe, and to unite with its Cosmic Creator, thus enabling the Cosmic atom to evolve through the phase of a traveling atom into a Great Entity.” 
Both the use of the word “human,” with all its muddy connotations and her description of the Great Entity which must be able to “function independently of the Cosmic impulse of its own momentum” imply that this process requires both individuation and free will.
Up to this point I’d imagined the lords of Flame and Form as having already gone through epigenesis long before the solar system came into being which is why they don’t go through it this time. However, if the Lords of Flame and the Lords of Form never undergo epigenesis at all, and thus never develop individuality or free will, doesn’t that also mean that they can never become Great Entities (which was previously stated as the goal of every atom in the universe)?
Does that make a bit more sense of where I’m hitting a snag?

@JMG
I leave it up to you to post the following or not. Not sure if its overly long but I read some other reader’s posts and I thought some folks might find the following interesting. 
@Cosmic Doctrine Readers
Here’s what Meher Baba has to say about the Swarms which I think is in agreement with Ms. Fortune.
Meher Baba God Speaks – p. 221 – 222
On gaining the human form, the second process begins; this process is that of reincarnation. At this point, the process of the winding up of sanskaras comes to an end. The drop-soul takes numerous human forms one by one; and these forms are exactly 84 lakhs in number. [my note: according to wikipedia 1 lakh equals 100,000.So 84 lakhs = 8,400,000 reincarnations]. 
These human forms are sometimes those of man and sometimes those of woman; and they change nationalities, appearance, colour and creed. The drop-soul through human incarnations experiences itself sometimes as a beggar and sometimes as a king, and thus gathers experiences of the opposites of happiness or misery according to its good or bad sanskaras. In reincarnation (i.e., in its successive and several human forms) the drop-soul retains its full consciousness but continues to have alternating experiences of opposite sanskaras, till the process of Realization begins. And during this process of realization the sanskaras get unwound. In reincarnations, there is a spending of sanskaras; but this spending up is quite different from the unwinding of sanskaras, which takes place during the process of Realization.
The spending up of sanskaras itself creates new sanskaras, which bind the soul; but the unwinding does not itself create fresh sanskaras, in which the drop-soul is caught.
Up to the human form, the winding up of sanskaras becomes stronger and stronger during the process of evolution. In the human forms of reincarnation, the winding continues to operate as a limiting factor; but with every change of the human bubble or form, the tight twists, gained during the process of winding, get loosened through 84 lakhs of shakings, before they are ready to unwind in the process of realization.
Now begins the third process of realization, which is the process of ascent. Here, the drop-soul undergoes the gradual unwinding of the sanskaras. During this process of unwinding, the sanskaras become fainter and fainter; and at the same time, the consciousness of the drop-soul gets directed more and more towards itself; and thus, the drop-soul passes through the subtle and mental planes till all the sanskaras disappear completely, enabling it to become conscious of itself as the ocean.
[end book quote]
*******
As I understand it Meher Baba is saying humanity (the current Swarm) undergoes the following process – evolution (winding up to consciousness)  >  reincarnation (unwinding the limitations accumulated to get consciousness) > realization (process to discover who and what one truly is) > true freedom/nirvana/moksha/liberation (i.e. outside the limitations of time/space and causality) = sat-chit-ananda or in English, Infinite Power, Infinite Knowledge, Infinite Bliss.
I also find it interesting that Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev says when he “looks within” himself (presumably he’s talking about samadhi) he sees evidence of 84 prior, sequential big bangs. Of those 84 the first 20 have become completely beyond the physical. When asked by a Physicist how he knows these prior Big Bangs happened if they’re non-physical now Sadhguru compared it to seeing the yearly growth rings on cut trees. He gave the example of a tree ring showing the effect of an ancient raging forest fire the tree endured. The forest fire is long gone but the evidence that it happened remains in the tree ring. Each universe (big bang) leaves behind evidence that it happened. Those earliest 20 are no longer physically manifest but because he sees the traces of their effects within himself he knows that once long ago they were still physical.
And according to Meher Baba the greatest gift any Perfect Master ever gives to a disciple is to make another being like himself (ie..one endowed with infinite power, infinite knowledge and infinite bliss). This is the true aim of the spiritual process all of humanity is currently on according to Baba.

As I was going about the end of season canning chores with my garden buddy today, I was struck by the way the the late afternoon sun was reflecting off of our shade cloth covering the summer kitchen and how pretty it was.  Also I was struck by the way the shade cloth participated in connecting the sun to my eye in a safe and interesting manner.  
Would I be right in supposing that the Lords of Form and Flame have a hand in how our sense of wonder, beauty and connection to the natural world grows and develops?  Would this qualify as something of an initiation every time we make these kinds of connections?

Phil, I sometimes wonder how much of the improvement in driving is a function of natural selection — those who drive really badly are, after all, rather less likely to leave as many descendants…
Jim W, yes, though Pluto doesn’t really fit Daath’s symbolism well – – and then where do you put Ceres and Sedna? 
Chris, that’s a fascinating question to which I’m far from sure I know the answer. I’m not at all sure Fortune’s metaphor incluces that. 
Eric, individualization and free will aren’t required in order to become a traveling atom in the Cosmos and eventually to become the Logos of a solar system; all that’s required is that the atom in question has achieved a level of complexity high enough not to settle out into one of the seven Cosmic planes. Fortune doesn’t show the Solar Logos of our system individualizing or having free will, for example. This is one of the ways in which the Cos. Doc. is very reminiscent, to me, of Stephen Wolfram’s A New Kind of Science — at various stages in the process of creation, genuine novelty comes into being out of the interaction of existing forces or factors. Epigenesis — which Fortune presents as the reality behind the concept of free will — is one of those genuinely new things; important as it is to us, it’s not common to all atoms. 
Happypandatao, fascinating. If I understand what Meher Baba is saying, the period of winding up the sanskaras is the descent down the seven planes and globes; the process of reincarnation is what happens here on this globe, and the ascent and unwinding of the sanskaras follows. This is also very reminiscent of the discussion of the descent and ascent of the soul in the Poimandres. 
Kay, yes and yes. Those experiences involve states of awareness that were given to us collectively by the Lords of Flame, resonating with the forms impressed in the material cosmos by the Lords of Form — and the sudden glimpses of wisdom and insight we get from them are part of the initiatory process by which we awaken into objective consciousness and superphysical awareness.

I heartily support the earlier comment suggesting you write a book dealing with occult philosophy directed toward Readers with a Western mindset. Actually, I think such a treatise would serve especially well as a sort of post graduate study for DA graduates, among Others, working to improve our understanding of Nature and how we fit into it on all levels of existence.







 Phutatorius says: 



								October 14, 2019 at 12:38 pm							




I’ve been reading ahead in CosDoc; I wanted to find some passages to which Gareth Knight referred in one of his books.  The Chapter titled “The Attraction of Outer Space” reminded me of what we’ve been referring to as “Faustian Culture” or is it “Faustian Civilization”?  I never cared for “Star Trek” at all and don’t think I’ve ever watched a complete episode.  Theirs is a sort of quasi-military, sterile existence, not at all “free” as we might imagine freedom.  The chapter also reminded me of Milton’s Satan.  Care to comment in advance of when we reach that chapter in a year or so?

JMG
Late in the week but I am encouraged by Chis’s query about entropy and your reply. That seemed to open a door for me. Lords of Flame have the energy; complexity will emerge as ‘form’ or ‘structure’ despite entropy increasing. But this observational  ‘knowledge’ could be beside the real point for us. The ‘reality’ of the ‘macrocosm’ can be approached in many different ways. The dynamic conveyed by these ‘Lords’ emerges in humans as wisdom and insight (your response to Kay). That could be ‘form’ or retained as ‘memory’, perhaps not degraded in increased entropy.. That is the macrocosm for us. Whatever.
Anyway, I’m working on it. Smile. There is stuff needs doing in the garden that we have had to neglect this year. .

JMG, who are the White Chiefs?  Dion Fortune mentions them but assumes readers know who they are, which was probably so at the time she was writing.







 John Michael Greer says: 



								October 16, 2019 at 12:12 am							




Jim, I’ve got that in my life planner — two incarnations from now I’ll get right on it. 😉
Disciple, it’s something I’ve wanted to do for some time, and if pledges via the mundane astrology project stay at their present level or increase, I should have the freedom to do something that non-commercial. It may be a couple of years, though, as it’s going to take a lot of reading, study, meditation, and visionary work! 
Phutatorius, excellent. Yes, exactly. Exactly. More on this when we get to that chapter…
Phil, yes, I think so. Working in the garden while mulling over the Cos. Doc. somehow seems just too British for words.  😉
Your Kittenship, back when she was writing, everybody in the occult scene knew the basic jargon of Theosophy and so she could drop phrases like that and assume that everyone would get them. The Secret Chiefs of the Great White Lodge, to give them their full and ornate title, in Theosophical legend are spiritual beings who have ascended far beyond the human level, having been at our level long ages ago, and who now concern themselves with helping human beings ascend in turn. Do they exist outside of metaphor? There are certainly beings, or forces that act like beings, that fill the role old-fashioned occultists described. I find Fortune’s own taxonomy of the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind a little less burdened with assumptions, but your cognitive mileage may vary!







 Lady Cutekitten of Lolcat says:

So the White Chiefs were people who, in effect, got promoted to guardian angels?  Were there also Black Chiefs?

Disciple & JMG
This could hang over till another time …
Writing the book could be a visionary experience in its own way.
Intrigued by ‘post-graduate study for DA graduates’ I found this wonderful picture https://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/ma-chinese-daoist-textual-studies/
In Lampeter: “Students will have the opportunity to learn from the best in the subject and to study using the unique pedagogic approach derived from the ‘Royal Great Learning’ (皇家太学) educational model, which relies upon intensive textual study and reflection.”
re Star Trek: the later stories can be seen perhaps as satire? Smile.

Probably I’m too late for the discussion, but it just occurred to me that the previous chapter of CosDoc is a great metaphor for reading the CosDoc and other deep and dense texts.
The Lords of Flame swarm represents the time when one first encounters the text. One hungrily devours the book from cover to cover, and gets an intuitive understanding of what the book says. In this way one gets attuned to the language and concepts and takes a glimpse of what’s at stake.
The Lords of Form swarm reminds of the second pass, when the book is read chapter by chapter. With the unconcious understanding already there, one is able to think more clearly and in more detais about what’s written in the book, and form the proper concepts in one’s head. However, if the book is deep enough (as CosDoc definetly is), the uderstanding becomes less and less clear, and at some point one realizes that something important has been missed from the earlier chapters. Then two conflicting urges arise: a desire to continue forward despite lack of full understanding, and desire to go a couple of chapters back to revisit what was already learnt. Usually at this point the impetus to read exhausts itself the book is put off for a while, as one is brooding on what’s been read and understood.
After several such iterations, the familiarity with the first chapters becomes such that one’s mind starts getting used to the concepts described and starts applying them in various ways, going beyond what’s described in the book. One can go as far as teaching the others. This evolution to me looks like what Dione Fortune describes about the Lords of Mind.

In order to conceptualize these ideas I believe 2 keys are necessary:
1. To first understand that we can only conceive of higher dimensions as an abstract concept, just as a 2 dimensional object may be understood as only (at best) a cross-section of a 3 dimensional object. Ergo, 3rd dimensional to 4th, 4th to 5th and so on. Movement through time as the creation of the 4th dimension is how we perceive this idea. Even this is within the prison of the human mind as within higher dimensions our beginning and end exist concurrently, insofar that the same relativity between dimensions exist as stated above. This is the alpha and omega of Christianity.
2. The relativity of time. The materiality of each dimensional framework rests upon the dimension below’s realisation of all probabilities. Our physicality relies upon the rapid movement of the atomic world – imagine waving a lightstick rapidly. If we could take a ‘snapshot’ within the atomic timeframe, we would appear insubstantial, similar to looking out into space. Similarly, the Universe, in order to perceive itself as a material being, requires it’s atomic elements (solar systems being analogous to an atom in this model) to complete entire, multiple, life cycles to be realised, including the realisation of all probabilities, and by extension, all possibilities. Entire planetary cycles must be completed in order to create one moment for God/the Universe. This only begins to indicate the complexity of the Logos. This is connected to the true meaning, in part, of God creating Man in his own image. Furthermore, there is an analogue between the synaptic transmission within ourselves (human Logos, if you will) and the Solar Logos. These ‘Logoi’ cannot be perceived physically from the realm below. Meaning is the apparatus of transmission, ‘meaning’ being that which compels all behaviour.
So, within ‘our’ timeframe we see our current Earth as a globe, from where we will eventually return our experiences to the Godhead (the swarm returning). From a higher dimensional time frame, we would experience possibly infinite globes existing and returning experiences to the Godhead. Just as the atomic world does for us, except for our lack of infinite, omniscient (and therefore inconceivable) consciousness.




Courteous, concise comments relevant to the topic of the current post are welcome, whether or not they agree with the views expressed here, and I try to respond to each comment as time permits. Long screeds proclaiming the infallibility of some ideology or other, however, will be deleted; so will repeated attempts to hammer on a point already addressed; so will comments containing profanity, abusive language, flamebaiting and the like -- I filled up my supply of Troll Bingo cards years ago and have no interest in adding any more to my collection; and so will sales spam and offers of "guest posts" pitching products. I'm quite aware that the concept of polite discourse is hopelessly dowdy and out of date, but then some people would say the same thing about the traditions this blog is meant to discuss.

Book Club Post The Cosmic Doctrine: The Lords of Mind as Initiators 
November 20, 2019November 20, 2019John Michael Greer17 Comments 


This week we continue a monthly discussion of The Cosmic Doctrine by Dion Fortune, which I consider the most important work of 20th century occult philosophy. Climb in and fasten your seat belts; it’s turning out to be as wild a ride as I expected. If you’re just joining us now, please go back and read the previous commentaries, which are listed here; the material covered in these earlier posts is essential to making sense of what follows.
As noted in earlier posts, there are two widely available editions of The Cosmic Doctrine, the revised edition first published in 1956 and the Millennium Edition first published in 1995, which reprints the original privately printed edition of 1949. You can use either one for the discussions that follow. The text varies somewhat between the two editions, but the concepts and images are the same, and I’ll be referring to both.
Assigned Reading: 
Revised Edition:  Chapter 17, “The Lords of Mind as Initiators,” pp. 80-83.
Millennium Edition: Chapter 18, “The Goal of Evolution of a Life Swarm,” from the fifth complete paragraph on p. 109 (“It is a peculiarity of all vibratory objects…”) to the end of the chapter.
Commentary:
Over the course of the last several chapters, we’ve covered the journey made by each of the three primal swarms from the upper spiritual plane all the way down to the plane of matter, where they awakened into objective consciousness and began the corresponding journey back up the planes. We’ve also talked about the swarms that follow the three primal swarms down the planes and then back up them again, and hinted at some of the ways that the primal swarms interact with the younger swarms that follow them down and then back up the planes.
The primal swarms are able to interact with the younger swarms in certain ways. The Lords of Flame and Form, who are not individualized beings, interact with the following swarms collectively rather than individually. The Lords of Mind, on the other hand, are fully individualized, and they can select individual members of the following swarms to initiate. Both these means of interaction are of crucial importance as we proceed, because the influence of elder swarms on younger swarms plays an increasingly important role in evolution as the solar system’s history unfolds.
To talk about this, Dion Fortune uses a metaphor that is precise but not always transparent to readers today. “It is a peculiarity of all vibratory objects,” she says, “that they tend to tune with their own vibrations all objects of a slower rhythm than themselves.” This is quite true, by the way—a vibrating object tends to make other objects vibrate in tune with it. Operatic sopranos used to use a trick based on this to show off the power and precision of their voices; they would sing at a note that made a wine glass vibrate, and then suddenly shift to another, discordant note.  The two sets of vibrations clashed and the glass literally exploded.
Metaphorically speaking, the same effect is used in a more constructive way by Divine Sparks on the way back up the planes as they interact with members of younger swarms on the way down.  The elder being can communicate to the younger some of the capacities it has evolved on its journey, thus giving the younger being a substantial head start in the process of evolution. That’s the nature and the purpose of initiation, and much of the rest of this chapter is among other things a discussion of how initiation works—veiled, of course, under the convenient concealment of the nearest approximate metaphor.
In Fortune’s great cosmic metaphor there are three general classes of initiation. There are the initiations of the descending arc, which are discussed early on in this chapter. There are the initiations of the ascending arc, which are mentioned at in this chapter but not discussed in detail until later. Then there is the initiation of the Nadir, the point at which the direction of movement changes and descent gives way to ascent; this is also discussed later on.
The initiations of the descending arc are useful here as illustrations precisely because most of them are far in our past, long before the swarm of which we are part finished the long journey down the planes to the world of material incarnation. We all know on some level what it means to descend fully into matter, because we have all done exactly that at an earlier stage in the evolution of our individual souls. We all have some sense, however subconscious, of what is involved in descending through each of the planes above the material, adapting to the greater density and inertia of each new plane in turn, because that experience has left enduring traces in us. That helps us grasp the very different phenomena of the initiations of the Nadir and the ascending arc.
It’s a classic bit of strategy that having started talking about initiation, Fortune suddenly veers in what looks like a new direction and begins to talk instead about what happens when the first three swarms complete the ascending arc and return to the Solar Logos. She’s not actually talking about something else, for what happens between the primal swarms and the Logos is a form of initiation. When the Lords of Flame set  out from the seventh plane, they were little bundles of looping tracks in space vibrating feebly to the rhythm of the Logos. When they return, they are almost unimaginably more complex, having absorbed the vibrations of every plane and developed capacities of action and reaction on all of them.
The Lords of Flame have also picked up the capacity to form a group spirit, and developed that capacity through the hard labor of creating Planetary Spirits on each of the seven planes. This is crucial to what follows. As the Lords of Flame return to the seventh plane, the Solar Logos contemplates them, picks up the intricate rhythms of vibration they have learned from their long journey, and is conditioned by those rhythms, absorbing the lessons they have learned in the same way that they absorbed the influence of the Solar Logos itself as they set out; as the Logos initiated them, so they in turn initiate the Logos. In the process, the Solar Logos becomes the group spirit of the Lords of the Flame—or more precisely, the group spirit is absorbed by the Logoidal consciousness and becomes one of the modes or capacities through which the Logos can experience and act.
And the Lords of Flame?  As noted in a previous commentary, they become those beings that occultists and ordinary religious believers call angels. More to the point, most of them do. Some of the Lords of Flame have reached the point of evolution at which they are capable of coming into conscious contact with the Cosmic atoms that created them, and these leave the solar system behind and begin the long journey of a traveling atom in the Cosmos, to become Great Entities and Solar Logoi themselves after a vast interval of time. The others remain with the Solar Logos of our solar system and carry out the will of the Solar Logos, moving up and down the planes to keep the solar system in harmony. As their journey down and then up the planes brought the basic pattern of natural forces into being, they work through those forces, maintaining the balance of nature when the epigenesis of younger swarms threatens to pull it out of balance.
The Lords of Form return in the same way and go through the same process. As mentioned in an earlier commentary, they become the beings known as devas by some occultists and intelligences by others. Those of the Lords of Form that don’t make contact with their Cosmic atoms and begin life as traveling atoms in the Cosmos carry out the will of the Logos in the same way as the Lords of Flame, but their task is different. The Logos, as it mediates between its solar system and the Cosmic tides, is constantly evolving new archetypal concepts, and the Lords of Form take these and impress them on swarms of younger Divine Sparks who are still evolving.
Thus the swarms don’t simply repeat the same sequence of bodies and states; they pass into new shapes and new experiences.  Glance back over the history of life, on the one hand, or the history of human culture on the other, and it isn’t hard to spot some of the archetypal ideas of the Logos as these arrive on the scene—for example, the way that mammals and birds, though belonging to distinct evolutionary lineages, both evolved warm blood around the same geological period, or the way that Greece, India, and China all invented philosophy in the same few centuries. In terms of Fortune’s great metaphor, these are among the works of the Lords of Form.
The Lords of Mind, finally, pass through the same process as their two preceding swarms, and become another set of spiritual beings that mediate between the Logos and its solar system. Like the other two primal swarms, their job is to range up and down the planes, bringing the solar system back into balance when it has been disordered by some vagary or other of epigenesis, but they can do so in a far subtler way than the others.  The Lords of Flame work with the forces of nature, the Lords of Form work with the group souls of younger swarms, but the Lords of Mind are individualized and so they work with individuals.
The Lords of Mind are thus responsible for initiation in the sense that occultists usually use that term, the initiations of the ascending arc: they assist individual members of younger swarms who have completed the descent through the planes, and begun the return journey, to perceive planes higher than their own and bring down forces from those planes to assist the work of balance. These initiations of the ascending arc are by no means limited to occult lodges. Those churches and other religious bodies that preserve traditional sacramental rituals have their own set of initiations: for example, baptism and the ceremony of communion are initiations of this type, and so are holy orders when these are conferred by a bishop who has received apostolic succession.
Other initiations have survived in seemingly unlikely places.  The initiations of Freemasonry, for example, are surprisingly potent even though most Masons have no notion of the real meaning of the rites they preserve and enact so carefully.  It also happens, and not infrequently, that a Lord of Mind will guide an individual Divine Spark of a younger swarm through an initiatory process entirely outside of any organizational framework, or in the context of some organization or tradition with no initiatory tradition at all. When you encounter a case of spontaneous mystical experience, that’s usually what has happened.
Nearly always, the Lords of Mind remain as disembodied (or differently embodied) presences, communicating with their initiates in subtle ways through the higher planes of being. Fortune has it, though, that now and again it becomes necessary for a Lord of Mind to take on a body on one of the planes of manifestation. This is done with the help of an initiate on that plane, who lends her reproductive system to the process. Yes, we’re talking about virgin birth. Those of my readers who know their way around global mythology will recall how many important mythic figures are said to be born of a human woman impregnated in one way or another by a deity—or, rather less often, of a goddess impregnated by a human man. This is what Fortune has in mind here. When she described herself as a devout but very unorthodox Christian, she wasn’t joking.
Having dropped that tidbit to annoy the orthodox and give the rest of us something to think about, Fortune veers straight to a different theme. She reminds us that the Solar Logos has three primary aspects, reflecting the three great rings of the Cosmos, and goes on to envision the three primal swarms as representatives of these three primary aspects. While these three swarms evolved under the influence of the Logos alone, those that come after evolve under the influence of the Logos and its Regents, who are the Lords of Flame, Form, and Mind.
The subsequent swarms are assigned, not to the three primary aspects, but to the twelve Cosmic rays that influence the Logos. Each swarm sets out from the seventh plane under the influence of one of these rays, and takes on the imprint of that ray. The group spirits of the later swarms, once they have finished their evolution take on a special role in the evolving solar system.  Only the three primal swarms have their group spirits absorbed by the Logos; the group spirits of the later swarms, once the Solar Logos has contemplated them and learned everything they have to teach, become the Star Logoi, exemplars of the influences of the twelve rays in the solar system, subordinate to the Solar Logos but distinct from it. (Later editions of the Cos. Doc. renamed the Star Logoi the Ray Exemplars, but here again, I find the original term more exact.)
With the birth of the last of the Star Logoi, the solar system is complete. At its center is the Solar Logos, surrounded by its hosts of angels, intelligences, and guardian spirits; the seven planes radiate out from it, each with its planet and Planetary Spirit, each inhabited by Divine Sparks descending and ascending the planes; around the outer rim stand the twelve Star Logoi, each mediating the energies of one of the zodiacal signs, each surrounded by its own cloud of spirits who have completed the journey through the planes and now dwell rejoicing in realms of light.
Those readers who know their way around the Qabalah, or more particularly around the specific version of the Qabalah discussed in great detail by Dion Fortune in her classic book on the subject, will find much of this image familiar, but not all.  Much more of it can be found in an equally ancient but far less heavily publicized tradition.  In the writings of late classical Neoplatonists such as Sallust and Proclus Diadochos, especially as interpreted by the great English Neoplatonist Thomas Taylor, Fortune’s great cosmic metaphor has its closest match. Read Sallust’s On the Gods and the World or Proclus’ Elements of Theology—again, Thomas Taylor’s translations and commentaries are the most revealing in this context—and it’s soon clear that you’re in the same cosmos Fortune has outlined in The Cosmic Doctrine.
This comes as no surprise. On the one hand, Fortune, her teacher Dr. Theodore Moriarty, and many of her close associates had a solid knowledge of occult philosophy, and at the time this normally included at least a nodding acquaintance with the writings of the old Neoplatonists. On the other, the entire Western occult tradition in modern times is a restatement of the Neoplatonic vision, as transmitted through the great Neoplatonic revival of the Renaissance.  This is one of the things that makes the Cos. Doc. so important as a work of modern occult philosophy: it presents, in the form of the nearest approximate metaphor, the vision of reality that has been central to the tradition it represents since ancient times.
With this chapter, accordingly, Fortune’s account of the genesis of the cosmos and the solar system draws to a close. In the months ahead, we’ll proceed to the third part of The Cosmic Doctrine and explore what it has to say about the process of initiation and spiritual development that awaits each of us, should we be willing to pursue it.
Notes for Study: 
As already noted, The Cosmic Doctrine is heavy going, especially for those who don’t have any previous exposure to occult philosophy. It’s useful to read through the assigned chapter once or twice, trying to get an overview, but after that take it a bit at a time. The best option for most people seems to be to set aside five or ten minutes a day during the month you spend on this chapter. During that daily session, take one short paragraph or half of a long one, read it closely, and think about what you’ve read, while picturing in your mind’s eye the image you’ve been given for that passage of text.
As you proceed through the chapter and its images, you’re likely to find yourself facing questions that the text doesn’t answer. Some of those are questions Fortune wants you to ask yourself, either because they’ll be answered later in the book or because they will encourage you to think in ways that will help you learn what the text has to say. It can be helpful to keep a notebook in which to write down such questions, as well as whatever thoughts and insights might come to you as you study the text.
Questions and comments can also be posted here for discussion. (I’d like to ask that only questions and comments relevant to The Cosmic Doctrine be posted here, to help keep things on topic.) We’ll go on to the next piece of the text on December 18.  Until then, have at it!

Just a quick note: I believe the pages for the Revised Edition:  Chapter 17, “The Lords of Mind as Initiators,” are pp. 80-83 (not pp. 76-79). Thanks

Pardon the length of this, I have been busy in the harvest, on retreat, and then buying a farm in upstate NY, so I haven’t posted in a while and have a lot to say.
This is great chapter. Reading it again this morning before my meditation revealed new meanings that are hard to articulate, but I shall try. First, let me say that I have been meditating through the great American mystic Franklin Merrell-Wolff’s masterpiece “Pathways Through to Space.” So that is where my mind is currently, and his general thrust is much more in the current of my main tradition, TAT (Truth And Transmission) the students of West Virginia mystic and occultist Richard Rose. The retreat I recently came back from was a group self-inquiry retreat(more like an intensive) with two mentors, Art and Anima. So that is where my mind is generally. Self Realization in this lifetime is the goal. 
So our greater goal according to Fortune is “the at-one-ment of the Group Soul with the Logoidal consciousness, whereby the Logos recieved the fruits of the evolution.” This is accomplished by withdrawal “up the planes.” So as we focus up the planes, and resonate at higher frequencies as it were, the lower habits drop away. This reminds me of something Art once said to me: “you can’t break habits, you can only trade up.” I have seen how this has worked out for me. Ten years ago I had habits of drinking to get drunk, smoking weed every day and thinking in ways that limited my possibilities. I didn’t have the power to meditate or much else. These days I have habits of meditating and doing ritual every day, of going on semi annual retreats, and of countering negative thoughts with reason and perspective. 
One of Rose’s practices that TAT still carries on is of sitting in silent group rapport. Often with members present who have found what they are looking for in this life. To me this seems like “sympathetic induction.” Of course, just spending time with beings further along than you is induction.
Going back to the Goal as stated by Fortune, I noticed in this reading that in the “at-one-ment” it is the Logos who recieves the fruits. This is because Group Soul, the “organized set of magnetic, capillary… stresses”, this entity that has gone through the evolution of the planes, IS the Logos. This is what Franklin Merrell-Wolff calls “Knowledge through Identity”, and as he says “God is either known directly through Identity, or He is not known at all.” There is something else here that I cannot say right now.
Also, there is a difference between “at-one-ment” and “making contact with their corresponding Cosmic Atom” – Realizing their True Self. 
One last thing, Anima recently reminded me that there is a difference between Transformation and Transcendence. It seems like this evolution of the soul is like Transformation, but the making contact with the Cosmic Atom is Transcendence.
As I have already gone on too long, and have other things to do, I shall stop for the time being, and while it seems worthwhile to think through these maps, I realize that they are metaphors, and no arrangement of words, images or ideas is the Truth. Thank you for your time and this book club, I look forward to it every month.

Isaac, thanks for this. Delighted to hear that you’re meditating on Merrell-Wolff’s work! I found his Philosophy of Consciousness Without an Object worth very close study and contemplation as well. I’m not familiar with Rose or his work — a useful reminder that there are more valuable teachings out there than anyone has time to find out about.. 
Sympathetic induction is indeed one of the great advantages of spending time with those further along the Path. Of course there’s a downside, which is that some people lose track of the hard work necessary to get to the same place when you’re away from the presence of a more advanced soul — but that’s what daily meditation is all about, of course. 😉

“It is a peculiarity of all vibratory objects, that they tend to tune with their own vibrations all objects of a slower rhythm than themselves”
I was meditating on some my fears yesterday and what came out of it has some relation to this passage.
I saw my fears and worries as little impish astral/etheric embodiments of fear itself. To be able to emit the vibrations of fear and to induce them in people, they are the vibrating fear itself. In other words, these little dirtbags are way more scared than I could possibly ever be and I can only have fear to the extent that I agree to vibrate (or dance!) to their rhythm. They are scared of us and what people are capable of and that’s why they prefer to act outside of our attention range and almost always indirectly.
The way it is related to Dion Fortune’s passage above, is that these fear imps, having a slower vibration compared to the rhythm of humans, cannot tune us to their vibration unless we willingly do so.

								November 20, 2019 at 9:20 pm							




As a logical continuation from this… When a human is going through an initiatory process being attuned to these higher vibrations, they spend less and less energy vibrating in the lower range providing less soil for the ‘fear imps’ and other malevolent beings to grow in. My experience is that these lower grade beings, who are used to have me as their source of subsistence, are using all their teeth and claws to hold onto their feedlot. There is a lot of inner resistance on every step on my path and sometimes it is gut wrenching. I’m only afraid that I haven’t seen the worst of it yet.
It sounds very much like the Watcher, only so far it’s coming more as a multitude of small entities rather than one ugly demon.

1. It seems fairly standard to describe angels as messengers of God, but the implication is usually of a one-way communication. So it’s refreshing to see a new wrinkle added, that angels convey messages from the universe back to God.
2. So is the implication that the Cosmic atoms are outside of the universe? Because there’s the bit here about the Lords of Flame making contact with the Cosmic atoms, and then on page 95 of the Millennium edition, the text talks about Cosmic atoms generating atoms in the reflected universe.
So the image that builds up in my mind is of the universe (our solar system) being a sort of dream-construct of the Solar Logos. Meanwhile, the external Cosmos is a sort of higher order reality, and my ‘substance’ is an emanation of a Cosmic atom moving around outside of the Logos-dream.
Either I’ve got completely the wrong idea, or Fortune keeps dropping these little hints and then refusing to talk about them.
3. In the Millennium edition, on page 113, it says that the Star Logoi are named the Ray Exemplars in earlier editions.

“On the outgoing arc of evolution, initiation is performed by contact with the life of a swarm on the returning arc.
Thus, initiation on the outgoing arc enables the initiate to cut across the arc of evolution, and to obtain the reactionary capacities by sympathetic induction, instead of by the lengthy process of experience. Initiation upon the returning arc is, however, a different process which will be considered in due course.
The function of initiates on the outgoing arc is to enable their swarms to adapt themselves more speedily to the conditions of a newly-achieved plane, because they have acquired some concept of the nature of these conditions. Thus, initiation on the outgoing arc enables an initiate to immerse himself more rapidly in matter.”
Forgive me if I am getting this completely wrong: Could a Lord of Mind be one of those beings on the outgoing arc?  If a Lord of Mind wanted to perform a task on the meat plane, for instance, jumping into the body of a sommelier to physically taste wine (which would presumably not harm the sommelier, and most likely the sommelier wouldn’t even realize it) is this within the family of things Fortune is talking about?







 John Michael Greer says: 



								November 21, 2019 at 12:10 am							




Ganesh, excellent! Yes, that follows precisely from what Fortune is saying. 
Cliff, 1) one of the things I like about Fortune’s cosmology is that God is still learning and growing. I note with some interest that this is also true in Alfred North Whitehead’s process theology, and it would be interesting to compare those in more detail. 2) Yes, the Cosmic atoms are not part of the solar system. Their movements, together with that of the Solar Logos, create the solar system and weave it together. Fortune in an earlier chapter compares the solar system to a dream shared by the Logos and the Cosmic atoms; what happens at this stage of the game is that some of the Cosmic atoms wake up. 3) Yes, that’s an artifact of the way the Cos. Doc. has been published. The original version, which was privately circulated used the term “Star Logoi;” the revised edition was the first one actually published, and said “Ray Exemplars;” the Millennium Edition uses the text of the original version and so goes back to “Star Logoi.” 
Kimberly, the Lords of Mind are indeed one source of initiations on the outgoing or descending arc, but there’s another source — the beings who are on the same plane on the incoming or ascending arc. When we were on the lower astral plane, for example, there was another swarm on that same plane which had already been to the material plane and was working its way back up, and they also helped initiate us.

Ganesh’s understanding of the ‘fear imps’ is the most important awareness here, and the only means to true spiritual revolution. These are the “legion, for we are many” the Master Jesus expels from the possessed into the bodies of swine, causing them to leap from the clifftops and into the ocean. This is a parable of the spiritual cycles of Samsara. The possessed man of those times is the ordinary man of today, immersed in worldly concerns corresponding to the 7 infernal spheres connected with the 7 deadly sins. These can be understood through descending and ascending octaves and the laws that dictate their nature.
By casting out these demons of fear, anger, lust, pride etc. we liberate ourselves. I would add, Ganesh, that these imps are real inhabitants of your internal worlds that you understand should not only not be nourished further, but eliminated completely.

Just nitpicking but your explanation of the shattered wineglass is false. You excite the wineglass at its resonant frequency and eventually the amplitude corresponding to the energy you’ve added is too much for the material to take.
See http://demoweb.physics.ucla.edu/content/50-breaking-glass-sound

JMG
Talking about approximate metaphors (I have always been a little unsure of the wine glass) pendulum clocks if placed on a common surface  will synchronize (attune).  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23580 The metaphor cannot be exact perhaps, as vibration in deterministic terms leaves little room for immaterial mind. 
Incidentally, I did not know about Theodore Moriarty. Thanks for drawing attention to him and the ancient Neoplatonists. The name resonates with Sherlock Holmes and for some of us here in Britain, with 50s comedy radio; ‘Goon Show’; Milligan, Sellers, Secombe & Bentine. I guess the name was borrowed and had resonance in popular culture. The character they invented was elaborated and embroidered with contradictions.
Much to meditate on this month … thanks

John–
The theme of descending and reascending the planes–which appears in Fortune and unsurprisingly Blavatsky, given that the latter was a source for the former–has always puzzled me.  My question comes back to “why?”
Why would a being, who is already residing in the highest plane, descend into the lesser planes–on purpose–in order to be forced to work its way back to the state of perfection which it had already possessed?  It seems like saying–well, I’m healthy, so I need to go get really, really sick so that I can have a laborious convalescence and spend an immense amount of time and effort healing so that I can be healthy again.  
Why would any rational actor do such a thing?  The obvious path would be to simply remain healthy in the first place.

I was studying figure 19 in the Millennial edition and I noticed that the column of globes shows that plane seven has one globe; six has two; five has three; four has four then instead of plane five having five globes as figure 16 shows, it has three.  Then plane six has two and seven, one.  I am a bit confused.  Did I miss something somewhere?

This may be explained in the book, which I concluded a long time ago was over my head—but how can God, who is by definition omnipotent, still be learning?  Doesn’t the omnipotent, by definition, already know everything?  I don’t get this idea at all.  
Also, I thought our host might be pleased to see this article which agrees with him on the use of unDruidly words:

Ha, yes. As Merrell-Wolff states “the Illumined Man is actually present in His works, in His speech and His writings.” So meditating through a book such as this seems like a great way to encourage Induction!
As for the downside, I have only to think of the stories the old timers at TAT tell… when Rose started teaching in the early 70s, he mainly had college age male students, and even though he said he wouldn’t come for them in a wheel barrow and that they had to exert tremendous effort, they still mostly hung around waiting for him to “zap” them. There is one story of a certain Jane who accidently got “zapped” with the experience of seeing everything as Empty, and ended up slobbering on the floor for hours. Apparently she didn’t have the capacity to see herself as empty, just everything else. So students waited for Transmission, but as Fortune says, the Initiator can only entrain up to the student’s capacity! It wasn’t until Rose was in a nursing home in the late 90’s and early 00’s that his remaining students realized he really wasn’t coming for them in a wheel barrow and some started “popping.” (To be fair, many of them did take his recommendations and exerted tremendous effort over many years.)

Niconic, the only beings who have the right to say that this or that is the “only means to true spiritual revolution” are the fully enlightened. Are you claiming that status for yourself? 
Lievenm, hmm! Okay, fair enough. I was apparently misinformed. 
Phil, I’ve sometimes thought about doing a Sherlock Holmes pastiche in which Dion Fortune’s teacher was indeed that Dr. Moriarty!
David BTL, you’re forgetting that before they descend to the material plane, souls don’t yet have objective consciousness — as Fortune says, they’re in what amounts to a dream state, and they don’t descend “on purpose” in the sense we’d use that phrase. They sink into deeper and deeper levels of dream, until they reach the material plane, wake up, and work their way back up the planes, becoming conscious in a full objective sense of everything they absorbed subjectively on the way down. 
Kay, you’re right that there should be seven globes on the lowest plane, not one. I suspect that the numbers in the circles have some other reference which isn’t clear from the diagram. 
Your Kittenship, but God isn’t omnipotent by definition. By and large, it’s only in the Abrahamic faiths that God is assigned that quality. In this chapter, Fortune mentions that when a swarm returns to the Solar Logos, it has reached a level of complexity comparable to the Solar Logos and could resist the will of the Logos. So the Solar Logos, vast and wise as it is, is still capable of learning and growing — it doesn’t have the static perfection that some theologies assign to the Deity. 
Isaac, oh dear gods, yes. I think it was Aleister Crowley who said that he found the best way to chase off most of his would-be students was to require them to do half an hour of honest work. I no longer accept personal students at all for much the same reason — over and over again, with painfully few exceptions, the people who’ve wanted to study with me personally didn’t want to do any spiritual work; they just wanted wallow in whatever ego-boost they could get from being a personal student of a moderately well known occult teacher, and parade that status around online. The people who are serious about doing the work are by and large the ones who pick up a book or a study course and do it, or simply pop in now and then to ask a question or get some advice.




Courteous, concise comments relevant to the topic of the current post are welcome, whether or not they agree with the views expressed here, and I try to respond to each comment as time permits. Long screeds proclaiming the infallibility of some ideology or other, however, will be deleted; so will repeated attempts to hammer on a point already addressed; so will comments containing profanity, abusive language, flamebaiting and the like -- I filled up my supply of Troll Bingo cards years ago and have no interest in adding any more to my collection; and so will sales spam and offers of "guest posts" pitching products. I'm quite aware that the concept of polite discourse is hopelessly dowdy and out of date, but then some people would say the same thing about the traditions this blog is meant to discuss.
